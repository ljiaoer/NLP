AB There is no doubt that big data are now rapidly expanding in all science and engineering domains. While the potential of these massive data is undoubtedly significant, fully making sense of them requires new ways of thinking and novel learning techniques to address the various challenges. In this paper, we present a literature survey of the latest advances in researches on machine learning for big data processing. First, we review the machine learning techniques and highlight some promising learning methods in recent studies, such as representation learning, deep learning, distributed and parallel learning, transfer learning, active learning, and kernel-based learning. Next, we focus on the analysis and discussions about the challenges and possible solutions of machine learning for big data. Following that, we investigate the close connections of machine learning with signal processing techniques for big data processing. Finally, we outline several open issues and research trends.

AB As a promising machine learning tool to handle the accurate pattern recognition from complex raw data, deep learning (DL) is becoming a powerful method to add intelligence to wireless networks with large-scale topology and complex radio conditions. DL uses many neural network layers to achieve a brain-like acute feature extraction from high-dimensional raw data. It can be used to find the network dynamics (such as hotspots, interference distribution, congestion points, traffic bottlenecks, spectrum availability, etc.) based on the analysis of a large amount of network parameters (such as delay, loss rate, link signal-to-noise ratio, etc.). Therefore, DL can analyze extremely complex wireless networks with many nodes and dynamic link quality. This paper performs a comprehensive survey of the applications of DL algorithms for different network layers, including physical layer modulation/coding, data link layer access control/resource allocation, and routing layer path search, and traffic balancing. The use of DL to enhance other network functions, such as network security, sensing data compression, etc., is also discussed. Moreover, the challenging unsolved research issues in this field are discussed in detail, which represent the future research trends of DL-based wireless networks. This paper can help the readers to deeply understand the state-of-the-art of the DL-based wireless network designs, and select interesting unsolved issues to pursue in their research.

AB Scene labeling consists of labeling each pixel in an image with the category of the object it belongs to. We propose a method that uses a multiscale convolutional network trained from raw pixels to extract dense feature vectors that encode regions of multiple sizes centered on each pixel. The method alleviates the need for engineered features, and produces a powerful representation that captures texture, shape, and contextual information. We report results using multiple postprocessing methods to produce the final labeling. Among those, we propose a technique to automatically retrieve, from a pool of segmentation components, an optimal set of components that best explain the scene; these components are arbitrary, for example, they can be taken from a segmentation tree or from any family of oversegmentations. The system yields record accuracies on the SIFT Flow dataset (33 classes) and the Barcelona dataset (170 classes) and near-record accuracy on Stanford background dataset (eight classes), while being an order of magnitude faster than competing approaches, producing a 320 x 240 image labeling in less than a second, including feature extraction.

DT Article
ID CRACK DETECTION; MACHINE; TRANSFORM; VISION
AB Computer vision-based techniques were developed to overcome the limitations of visual inspection by trained human resources and to detect structural damage in images remotely, but most methods detect only specific types of damage, such as concrete or steel cracks. To provide quasi real-time simultaneous detection of multiple types of damages, a Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN)-based structural visual inspection method is proposed. To realize this, a database including 2,366 images (with 500 x 375 pixels) labeled for five types of damagesconcrete crack, steel corrosion with two levels (medium and high), bolt corrosion, and steel delaminationis developed. Then, the architecture of the Faster R-CNN is modified, trained, validated, and tested using this database. Results show 90.6%, 83.4%, 82.1%, 98.1%, and 84.7% average precision (AP) ratings for the five damage types, respectively, with a mean AP of 87.8%. The robustness of the trained Faster R-CNN is evaluated and demonstrated using 11 new 6,000 x 4,000-pixel images taken of different structures. Its performance is also compared to that of the traditional CNN-based method. Considering that the proposed method provides a remarkably fast test speed (0.03 seconds per image with 500 x 375 resolution), a framework for quasi real-time damage detection on video using the trained networks is developed.

ID VISIBLE IMAGES; QUALITY; CLASSIFICATION; TRANSFORM; CURVELETS
AB Remote sensing images with different spatial and spectral resolution, such as panchromatic (PAN) images and multispectral (MS) images, can be captured by many earth-observing satellites. Normally, PAN images possess high spatial resolution but low spectral resolution, while MS images have high spectral resolution with low spatial resolution. In order to integrate spatial and spectral information contained in the PAN and MS images, image fusion techniques are commonly adopted to generate remote sensing images at both high spatial and spectral resolution. In this study, based on the deep convolutional neural network, a remote sensing image fusion method that can adequately extract spectral and spatial features from source images is proposed. The major innovation of this study is that the proposed fusion method contains a two branches network with the deeper structure which can capture salient features of the MS and PAN images separately. Besides, the residual learning is adopted in our network to thoroughly study the relationship between the high- and low-resolution MS images. The proposed method mainly consists of two procedures. First, spatial and spectral features are respectively extracted from the MS and PAN images by convolutional layers with different depth. Second, the feature fusion procedure utilizes the extracted features from the former step to yield fused images. By evaluating the performance on the Quick Bird and Gaofen-1 images, our proposed method provides better results compared with other classical methods.

AB In this paper, we propose a new face de-identification method based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to protect visual facial privacy, which is an end-to-end method (herein, FPGAN). First, we propose FPGAN and mathematically prove its convergence. Then, a generator with an improved U Net is used to enhance the quality of the generated image, and two discriminators with a seven-layer network architecture are designed to strengthen the feature extraction ability of FPGAN. Subsequently, we propose the pixel loss, content loss, adversarial loss functions and optimization strategy to guarantee the performance of FPGAN. In our experiments, we applied FPGAN to face de-identification in social robots and analyzed the related conditions that could affect the model. Moreover, we proposed a new face de-identification evaluation protocol to check the performance of the model. This protocol can be used for the evaluation of face de-identification and privacy protection. Finally, we tested our model and four other methods on the CelebA, MORPH, RaFD, and FBDe datasets. The results of the experiments show that FPGAN outperforms the baseline methods. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE empathy; immersive journalism; journalism ethics; media philosophy;

ID NEUROSCIENCE; PSYCHOLOGY
AB Major news outlets such as the New York Times and the Guardian have recently launched ambitious immersive journalism projects. Adopting the technologies and rhetoric of immersive journalism first presented by Nonny de la Pena in 2010, these news outlets seek to use virtual reality and 360 video to create deeper engagement and empathy with their audiences. Yet can immersive journalism enhance empathy? This question is unanswerable without a thorough discussion of the concept of empathy, a discussion that so far has been missing in the academic literature and popular commentary. This article addresses the gap by presenting current debates about the definition of empathy and using these debates to critically assess de la Pena's immersive journalism projects "IPSRESS" and "Hunger in Los Angeles," and the recent New York Times "The Displaced" and Guardian's "6 x 9" immersive journalism projects. The conclusion is twofold: On the one hand, I will argue that some immersive journalism projects are approaching a format that may enhance empathy, and on the other hand, I will propose that the project of immersive journalism needs to go beyond this goal and into adopting a more forceful role in shaping the future of virtual reality.

AB Plant phenomics has received increasing interest in recent years in an attempt to bridge the genotype-to-phenotype knowledge gap. There is a need for expanded high-throughput phenotyping capabilities to keep up with an increasing amount of data from high-dimensional imaging sensors and the desire to measure more complex phenotypic traits (Knecht et al., 2016). In this paper, we introduce an open-source deep learning tool called Deep Plant Phenomics. This tool provides pre-trained neural networks for several common plant phenotyping tasks, as well as an easy platform that can be used by plant scientists to train models for their own phenotyping applications. We report performance results on three plant phenotyping benchmarks fromthe literature, including state of the art performance on leaf counting, as well as the first published results for the mutant classification and age regression tasks for Arabidopsis thaliana.

AB Binary feature descriptors such as local binary patterns (LBP) and its variations have been widely used in many face recognition systems due to their excellent robustness and strong discriminative power. However, most existing binary face descriptors are hand-crafted, which require strong prior knowledge to engineer them by hand. In this paper, we propose a compact binary face descriptor (CBFD) feature learning method for face representation and recognition. Given each face image, we first extract pixel difference vectors (PDVs) in local patches by computing the difference between each pixel and its neighboring pixels. Then, we learn a feature mapping to project these pixel difference vectors into low-dimensional binary vectors in an unsupervised manner, where 1) the variance of all binary codes in the training set is maximized, 2) the loss between the original real-valued codes and the learned binary codes is minimized, and 3) binary codes evenly distribute at each learned bin, so that the redundancy information in PDVs is removed and compact binary codes are obtained. Lastly, we cluster and pool these binary codes into a histogram feature as the final representation for each face image. Moreover, we propose a coupled CBFD (C-CBFD) method by reducing the modality gap of heterogeneous faces at the feature level to make our method applicable to heterogeneous face recognition. Extensive experimental results on five widely used face datasets show that our methods outperform state-of-the-art face descriptors.

TI Automated Grading of Age-Related Macular Degeneration From Color Fundus
   Images Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
SO JAMA OPHTHALMOLOGY

DT Article

AB IMPORTANCE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects millions of people throughout the world. The intermediate stage may go undetected, as it typically is asymptomatic. However, the preferred practice patterns for AMD recommend identifying individuals with this stage of the disease to educate how to monitor for the early detection of the choroidal neovascular stage before substantial vision loss has occurred and to consider dietary supplements that might reduce the risk of the disease progressing from the intermediate to the advanced stage. Identification, though, can be time-intensive and requires expertly trained individuals.
   OBJECTIVE To develop methods for automatically detecting AMD from fundus images using a novel application of deep learning methods to the automated assessment of these images and to leverage artificial intelligence advances.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Deep convolutional neural networks that are explicitly trained for performing automated AMD grading were compared with an alternate deep learning method that used transfer learning and universal features and with a trained clinical grader. Age-related macular degeneration automated detection was applied to a 2-class classification problem in which the task was to distinguish the disease-free/early stages from the referable intermediate/advanced stages. Using several experiments that entailed different data partitioning, the performance of the machine algorithms and human graders in evaluating more than 130 000 images that were deidentified with respect to age, sex, and race/ethnicity from 4613 patients against a gold standard included in the National Institutes of Health Age-Related Eye Disease Study data set was evaluated.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Accuracy, receiver operating characteristics and area under the curve, and. score.
   RESULTS The deep convolutional neural network method yielded accuracy that ranged between 88.4%(SD, 0.5%) and 91.6%(SD, 0.1%), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was between 0.94 and 0.96, and. (SD) between 0.764 (0.010) and 0.829 (0.003), which indicated a substantial agreement with the gold standard Age-Related Eye Disease Study data set.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Applying a deep learning-based automated assessment of AMD from fundus images can produce results that are similar to human performance levels. This study demonstrates that automated algorithms could play a role that is independent of expert human graders in the current management of AMD and could address the costs of screening or monitoring, access to health care, and the assessment of novel treatments that address the development or progression of AMD.

ID WIND; METHODOLOGY; UNCERTAINTY
AB Scenario generation is an important step in the operation and planning of power systems with high renewable penetrations. In this work, we proposed a data-driven approach for scenario generation using generative adversarial networks, which is based on two interconnected deep neural networks. Compared with existing methods based on probabilistic models that are often hard to scale or sample from, our method is data-driven, and captures renewable energy production patterns in both temporal and spatial dimensions for a large number of correlated resources. For validation, we use wind and solar times-series data from NREL integration data sets. We demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate realistic wind and photovoltaic power profiles with full diversity of behaviors. We also illustrate how to generate scenarios based on different conditions of interest by using labeled data during training. For example, scenarios can be conditioned on weather events (e.g., high wind day, intense ramp events, or large forecasts errors) or time of the year (e.g., solar generation for a day in July). Because of the feedforward nature of the neural networks, scenarios can be generated extremely efficiently without sophisticated sampling techniques.

AB Molecular "fingerprints" encoding structural information are the workhorse of cheminformatics and machine learning in drug discovery applications. However, fingerprint representations necessarily emphasize particular aspects of the molecular structure while ignoring others, rather than allowing the model to make data-driven decisions. We describe molecular graph convolutions, a machine learning architecture for learning from undirected graphs, specifically small molecules. Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular graph-atoms, bonds, distances, etc.-which allows the model to take greater advantage of information in the graph structure. Although graph convolutions do not outperform all fingerprint-based methods, they (along with other graph-based methods) represent a new paradigm in ligand-based virtual screening with exciting opportunities for future improvement.

AB Cancer histology reflects underlying molecular processes and disease progression and contains rich phenotypic information that is predictive of patient outcomes. In this study, we show a computational approach for learning patient outcomes from digital pathology images using deep learning to combine the power of adaptive machine learning algorithms with traditional survival models. We illustrate how these survival convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) can integrate information from both histology images and genomic biomarkers into a single unified framework to predict time-to-event outcomes and show prediction accuracy that surpasses the current clinical paradigm for predicting the overall survival of patients diagnosed with glioma. We use statistical sampling techniques to address challenges in learning survival from histology images, including tumor heterogeneity and the need for large training cohorts. We also provide insights into the prediction mechanisms of SCNNs, using heat map visualization to show that SCNNs recognize important structures, like microvascular proliferation, that are related to prognosis and that are used by pathologists in grading. These results highlight the emerging role of deep learning in precision medicine and suggest an expanding utility for computational analysis of histology in the future practice of pathology.

AB Colloquially known as coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that causes CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become a matter of grave concern for every country around the world. The rapid growth of the pandemic has wreaked havoc and prompted the need for immediate reactions to curb the effects. To manage the problems, many research in a variety of area of science have started studying the issue. Artificial Intelligence is among the area of science that has found great applications in tackling the problem in many aspects. Here, we perform an overview on the applications of AI in a variety of fields including diagnosis of the disease via different types of tests and symptoms, monitoring patients, identifying severity of a patient, processing covid-19 related imaging tests, epidemiology, pharmaceutical studies, etc. The aim of this paper is to perform a comprehensive survey on the applications of AI in battling against the difficulties the outbreak has caused. Thus we cover every way that AI approaches have been employed and to cover all the research until the writing of this paper. We try organize the works in a way that overall picture is comprehensible. Such a picture, although full of details, is very helpful in understand where AI sits in current pandemonium. We also tried to conclude the paper with ideas on how the problems can be tackled in a better way and provide some suggestions for future works. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing volume of user-generated content on the web has made sentiment analysis an important tool for the extraction of information about the human emotional state. A current research focus for sentiment analysis is the improvement of granularity at aspect level, representing two distinct aims: aspect extraction and sentiment classification of product reviews and sentiment classification of target-dependent tweets. Deep learning approaches have emerged as a prospect for achieving these aims with their ability to capture both syntactic and semantic features of text without requirements for high-level feature engineering, as is the case in earlier methods. In this article, we aim to provide a comparative review of deep learning for aspect-based sentiment analysis to place different approaches in context. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we monolithically integrate hafnium oxide-based memristors with a foundrymade transistor array into a multiple-layer neural network. We experimentally demonstrate in situ learning capability and achieve competitive classification accuracy on a standard machine learning dataset, which further confirms that the training algorithm allows the network to adapt to hardware imperfections. Our simulation using the experimental parameters suggests that a larger network would further increase the classification accuracy. The memristor neural network is a promising hardware platform for artificial intelligence with high speed-energy efficiency.

AB Recognition of epileptic seizure type is essential for the neurosurgeon to understand the cortical connectivity of the brain. Though automated early recognition of seizures from normal electroencephalogram (EEG) was existing, no attempts have been made towards the classification of variants of seizures. Therefore, this study attempts to classify seven variants of seizures with non-seizure EEG through the application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning by making use of the Temple University Hospital EEG corpus. The objective of our study is to perform a multiclass classification of epileptic seizure type, which includes simple partial, complex partial, focal non-specific, generalized non-specific, absence, tonic, and tonic-clonic, and non-seizures. The 19 channels EEG time series was converted into a spectrogram stack before feeding as input to CNN. The following two different modalities were proposed using CNN: (1) Transfer learning using pretrained network, (2) Extract image features using pretrained network and classify using the support vector machine classifier. The following ten pretrained networks were used to identify the optimal network for the proposed study: Alexnet, Vgg16, Vgg19, Squeezenet, Googlenet, Inceptionv3, Densenet201, Resnetl8, Resnet50, and Resnet101. The highest classification accuracy of 82.85% (using Googlenet) and 88.30% (using Inceptionv3) was achieved using transfer learning and extract image features approach respectively. Comparison results showed that CNN based approach outperformed conventional feature and clustering based approaches. It can be concluded that the EEG based classification of seizure type using CNN model could be used in pre-surgical evaluation for treating patients with epilepsy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Increasingly, retailers rely on interactive technologies to improve consumers' shopping experiences. On the one side, interactive kiosks and smart mirrors make use of dedicated devices and software to explain, configure, and recommend products. On the other side, computer programs - so-called apps - are installed on the consumer's own device for the same purpose. They can be used at home, or - if installed on a mobile device - in retail outlets or on the move. In all cases, augmented reality (AR) can support these purposes by placing virtual content (e.g. new furniture) in a real environment (the consumer's home). The overall perception and acceptance toward such interactive technologies are discussed in this paper. Users' perceptions and experiences are measured by applying a modified technology acceptance model (TAM). Four experiments, two with marker-based and two with markerless AR apps are presented to support the generalization of the results, the measurement models and the measurement approach. The results are satisfactory with regard to the robustness of the TAM model. However, the relative importance of hedonic (enjoyment, pleasure, fun) and utilitarian (information) aspects varies for different kinds of AR apps and has to be considered for improvement to occur. From a measurement point of view the acquiescence bias has to be dealt with when developing scale items. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Traffic flow prediction plays a key role in intelligent transportation systems. However, since traffic sensors are typically manually controlled, traffic flow data with varying length, irregular sampling and missing data are difficult to exploit effectively. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach that is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in this paper. In addition, the multiscale temporal smoothing is employed to infer lost data and the prediction residual is learned by our approach. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on both the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) data set and our own traffic flow data set. According to the experimental results, our approach obtains higher accuracy in traffic flow prediction compared with other approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The superiority of deeply learned pedestrian representations has been reported in very recent literature of person re-identification (re-ID). In this article, we consider the more pragmatic issue of learning a deep feature with no or only a few labels. We propose a progressive unsupervised learning (PUL) method to transfer pretrained deep representations to unseen domains. Our method is easy to implement and can be viewed as an effective baseline for unsupervised re-ID feature learning. Specifically, PUL iterates between (1) pedestrian clustering and (2) fine-tuning of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve the initialization model trained on the irrelevant labeled dataset. Since the clustering results can be very noisy, we add a selection operation between the clustering and fine-tuning. At the beginning, when the model is weak, CNN is fine-tuned on a small amount of reliable examples that locate near to cluster centroids in the feature space. As the model becomes stronger, in subsequent iterations, more images are being adaptively selected as CNN training samples. Progressively, pedestrian clustering and the CNN model are improved simultaneously until algorithm convergence. This process is naturally formulated as self-paced learning. We then point out promising directions that may lead to further improvement. Extensive experiments on three large-scale re-ID datasets demonstrate that PUL outputs discriminative features that improve the re-ID accuracy. Our code has been released at https://github.com/hehefan/Unsupervised- Person- Re- identification- Clustering- and- Fine- tuning.

AB The rapid uptake of mobile devices and the rising popularity of mobile applications and services pose unprecedented demands on mobile and wireless networking infrastructure. Upcoming 5G systems are evolving to support exploding mobile traffic volumes, real-time extraction of fine-grained analytics, and agile management of network resources, so as to maximize user experience. Fulfilling these tasks is challenging, as mobile environments are increasingly complex, heterogeneous, and evolving. One potential solution is to resort to advanced machine learning techniques, in order to help manage the rise in data volumes and algorithm-driven applications. The recent success of deep learning underpins new and powerful tools that tackle problems in this space. In this paper, we bridge the gap between deep learning and mobile and wireless networking research, by presenting a comprehensive survey of the crossovers between the two areas. We first briefly introduce essential background and state-of-the-art in deep learning techniques with potential applications to networking. We then discuss several techniques and platforms that facilitate the efficient deployment of deep learning onto mobile systems. Subsequently, we provide an encyclopedic review of mobile and wireless networking research based on deep learning, which we categorize by different domains. Drawing from our experience, we discuss how to tailor deep learning to mobile environments. We complete this survey by pinpointing current challenges and open future directions for research.

AB Machine learning (ML) has disrupted a wide range of science and engineering disciplines in recent years. ML applications in optical communications and networking are also gaining more attention, particularly in the areas of nonlinear transmission systems, optical performance monitoring, and cross-layer network optimizations for software-defined networks. However, the extent to which ML techniques can benefit optical communications and networking is not clear and this is partly due to an insufficient understanding of the nature of ML concepts. This paper aims to describe the mathematical foundations of basic ML techniques from communication theory and signal processing perspectives, which in turn will shed light on the types of problems in optical communications and networking that naturally warrant ML use. This will be followed by an overview of ongoing ML research in optical communications and networking with a focus on physical layer issues.

ID QUANTUM; DIAGRAM
AB Machine learning offers an unprecedented perspective for the problem of classifying phases in condensed matter physics. We employ neural-network machine learning techniques to distinguish finite-temperature phases of the strongly correlated fermions on cubic lattices. We show that a three-dimensional convolutional network trained on auxiliary field configurations produced by quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model can correctly predict the magnetic phase diagram of the model at the average density of one (half filling). We then use the network, trained at half filling, to explore the trend in the transition temperature as the system is doped away from half filling. This transfer learning approach predicts that the instability to the magnetic phase extends to at least 5% doping in this region. Our results pave the way for other machine learning applications in correlated quantum many-body systems.

AB Humans are undergoing a fateful transformation focusing on artificial intelligence, quantum information technology, virtual reality, etc., which is inseparable from intelligent nano-micro devices. However, the booming of "Big Data" brings about an even greater challenge by growing electromagnetic radiation. Herein, an innovative flexible multifunctional microsensor is proposed, opening up a new horizon for intelligent devices. It integrates "non-crosstalk" multiple perception and green electromagnetic interference shielding only in one pixel, with satisfactory sensitivity and fast information feedback. Importantly, beneficial by deep insight into the variable-temperature electromagnetic response, the microsensor tactfully transforms the urgent threat of electromagnetic radiation into "wealth," further integrating self-power. This result will refresh researchers' realization of next-generation devices, ushering in a new direction for aerospace engineering, remote sensing, communications, medical treatment, biomimetic robot, prosthetics, etc.

AB We propose a dual pathway, 11-layers deep, three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network for the challenging task of brain lesion segmentation. The devised architecture is the result of an in-depth analysis of the limitations of current networks proposed for similar applications. To overcome the computational burden of processing 3D medical scans, we have devised an efficient and effective dense training scheme which joins the processing of adjacent image patches into one pass through the network while automatically adapting to the inherent class imbalance present in the data. Further, we analyze the development of deeper, thus more discriminative 3D CNNs. In order to incorporate both local and larger contextual information, we employ a dual pathway architecture that processes the input images at multiple scales simultaneously. For post-processing of the network's soft segmentation, we use a 3D fully connected Conditional Random Field which effectively removes false positives. Our pipeline is extensively evaluated on three challenging tasks of lesion segmentation in multi-channel MRI patient data with traumatic brain injuries, brain tumours, and ischemic stroke. We improve on the state-of-the-art for all three applications, with top ranking performance on the public benchmarks BRATS 2015 and ISLES 2015. Our method is computationally efficient, which allows its adoption in a variety of research and clinical settings. The source code of our implementation is made publicly available.

AB Effective intelligent fault diagnosis has long been a research focus on the condition monitoring of rotary machinery systems. Traditionally, time-domain vibration-based fault diagnosis has some deficiencies, such as complex computation of feature vectors, excessive dependence on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise, and limited capacity for learning complex relationships in fault signals. Furthermore, following the increase in condition data, how to promptly process the massive fault data and automatically provide accurate diagnosis has become an urgent need to solve. Inspired by the idea of compressed sensing and deep learning, a novel intelligent diagnosis method is proposed for fault identification of rotating machines. In this paper, a nonlinear projection is applied to achieve the compressed acquisition, which not only reduces the amount of measured data that contained all the information of faults but also realizes the automatic feature extraction in transform domain. For exploring the discrimination hidden in the acquired data, a stacked sparse autoencoders-based deep neural network is established and performed with an unsupervised learning procedure followed by a supervised fine-tuning process. We studied the significance of compressed acquisition and provided the effects of key factors and comparison with traditional methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using data sets from rolling element bearings and the analysis shows that it is able to obtain high diagnotic accuracies and is superior to the existing methods. The proposed method reduces the need of human labor and expertise and provides new strategy to handle the massive data more easily.

AB Person re-identification is a fundamental task in automated video surveillance and has been an area of intense research in the past few years. Given an image/video of a person taken from one camera, re-identification is the process of identifying the person from images/videos taken from a different camera. Re-identification is indispensable in establishing consistent labeling across multiple cameras or even within the same camera to reestablish disconnected or lost tracks. Apart from surveillance it has applications in robotics, multimedia and forensics. Person re-identification is a difficult problem because of the visual ambiguity and spatiotemporal uncertainty in a person's appearance across different cameras. These difficulties are often compounded by low resolution images or poor quality video feeds with large amounts of unrelated information in them that does not aid re-identification. The spatial or temporal conditions to constrain the problem are hard to capture. However, the problem has received significant attention from the computer vision research community due to its wide applicability and utility. In this paper, we explore the problem of person re-identification and discuss the current solutions. Open issues and challenges of the problem are highlighted with a discussion on potential directions for further research. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Systems developed to work with computational intelligence have become very efficient, and in some cases obtain more accurate results than evaluations by humans. Hence, this work proposes a new online approach based on deep learning tools according to the concept of transfer learning to generate a computational intelligence framework for use with the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) devices. This framework allows the user to add their images and perform platform training almost as easily as creating folders and placing files in regular cloud storage services. The trials carried out with the tool showed that even people with no programming and image processing knowledge were able to set up projects in a few minutes. The proposed approach is validated using three medical databases, which include cerebral vascular accident images for stroke type classification, lung nodule images for malignant classification, and skin images for the classification of melanocytic lesions. The results show the efficiency and reliability of the framework, which reached 91.6% Accuracy in the stroke images and lung nodules databases, and 92% Accuracy in the skin images databases. This prove the immense contribution that this work can bring to assist medical professionals in analyzing complex examinations quickly and accurately, allowing a large medical examination database through a consolidated collaborative IoT platform.

TI Pyramid Channel-based Feature Attention Network for image dehazing
SO COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING
LA English
DT Article
DE Image dehazing; Deep neural network; Channel attention
ID MODEL
AB Traditional deep learning-based image dehazing methods usually use the high-level features (which contain more semantic information) to remove haze in the input image, while ignoring the low-level features (which contain more detail information). In this paper, a Pyramid Channel-based Feature Attention Network (PCFAN) is proposed for single image dehazing, which leverages complementarity among different level features in a pyramid manner with channel attention mechanism. PCFAN consists of three modules: a three-scale feature extraction module, a pyramid channel-based feature attention module (PCFA), and an image reconstruction module. The three-scale feature extraction module simultaneously captures the low-level spatial structural features and the high-level contextual features in different scales. The PCFA module utilizes the feature pyramid and the channel attention mechanism, which effectively extracts interdependent channel maps and selectively aggregates the more important features in a pyramid manner for image dehazing. The image reconstruction module is used to reconstruct features to recover a clear image. Meanwhile, a loss function that combines a mean square error loss part and an edge loss part is employed in PCFAN, which can better preserve image details. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PCFAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on standard benchmark datasets in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and visual effect. The code will be made publicly available.

   Methods: In this paper we developed a Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) system based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that aims to help the radiologist classify mammography mass lesions. Deep learning usually requires large datasets to train networks of a certain depth from scratch. Transfer learning is an effective method to deal with relatively small datasets as in the case of medical images, although it can be tricky as we can easily start overfitting.
   Results: In this work, we explore the importance of transfer learning and we experimentally determine the best fine-tuning strategy to adopt when training a CNN model. We were able to successfully fine-tune some of the recent, most powerful CNNs and achieved better results compared to other state-of-the-art methods which classified the same public datasets. For instance we achieved 97.35% accuracy and 0.98 AUC on the DDSM database, 95.50% accuracy and 0.97 AUC on the INbreast database and 96.67% accuracy and 0.96 AUC on the BCDR database. Furthermore, after pre-processing and normalizing all the extracted Regions of Interest (ROIs) from the full mammograms, we merged all the datasets to build one large set of images and used it to fine-tune our CNNs. The CNN model which achieved the best results, a 98.94% accuracy, was used as a baseline to build the Breast Cancer Screening Framework. To evaluate the proposed CAD system and its efficiency to classify new images, we tested it on an independent database (MIAS) and got 98.23% accuracy and 0.99 AUC.
   Conclusion: The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed framework is performant and can indeed be used to predict if the mass lesions are benign or malignant. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic disease, which has already caused thousands of causalities and infected several millions of people worldwide. Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources.

AB To facilitate data-driven and informed decision making, a novel deep neural network architecture for human activity recognition based on multiple sensor data is proposed in this work. Specifically, the proposed architecture encodes the time series of sensor data as images (i.e., encoding one time series into a two-channel image), and leverages these transformed images to retain the necessary features for human activity recognition. In other words, based on imaging time series, wearable sensor-based human activity recognition can be realized by using computer vision techniques for image recognition. In particular, to enable heterogeneous sensor data to be trained cooperatively, a fusion residual network is adopted by fusing two networks and training heterogeneous data with pixel-wise correspondence. Moreover, different layers of deep residual networks are used to deal with dataset size differences. The proposed architecture is then extensively evaluated on two human activity recognition datasets (i.e., HHAR dataset and MHEALTH dataset), which comprise various heterogeneous mobile device sensor combinations (Le., acceleration, angular velocity, and magnetic field orientation). The findings demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms other competing approaches, in terms of accuracy rate and F1-value.

ID 3D HUMAN POSE; RECOGNITION; TRACKING; POINTS
AB Video-based human pose recovery is usually conducted by retrieving relevant poses using image features. In the retrieving process, the mapping between 2D images and 3D poses is assumed to be linear in most of the traditional methods. However, their relationships are inherently non-linear, which limits recovery performance of these methods. In this paper, we propose a novel pose recovery method using non-linear mapping with multi-layered deep neural network. It is based on feature extraction with multimodal fusion and back-propagation deep learning. In multimodal fusion, we construct hypergraph Laplacian with low-rank representation. In this way, we obtain a unified feature description by standard eigen-decomposition of the hypergraph Laplacian matrix. In back-propagation deep learning, we learn a non-linear mapping from 2D images to 3D poses with parameter fine-tuning. The experimental results on three data sets show that the recovery error has been reduced by 20%-25%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Since their inception in the 1930-1960s, the research disciplines of computational imaging and machine learning have followed parallel tracks and, during the last two decades, experienced explosive growth drawing on similar progress in mathematical optimization and computing hardware. While these developments have always been to the benefit of image interpretation and machine vision, only recently has it become evident that machine learning architectures, and deep neural networks in particular, can be effective for computational image formation, aside from interpretation. The deep learning approach has proven to be especially attractive when the measurement is noisy and the measurement operator ill posed or uncertain. Examples reviewed here are: super-resolution; lensless retrieval of phase and complex amplitude from intensity; photon-limited scenes, including ghost imaging; and imaging through scatter. In this paper, we cast these works in a common framework. We relate the deep-learning-inspired solutions to the original computational imaging formulation and use the relationship to derive design insights, principles, and caveats of more general applicability. We also explore how the machine learning process is aided by the physics of imaging when ill posedness and uncertainties become particularly severe. It is hoped that the present unifying exposition will stimulate further progress in this promising field of research.

AB Person re-identification (re-ID) is mostly viewed as an image retrieval problem. This task aims to search a query person in a large image pool. In practice, person re-ID usually adopts automatic detectors to obtain cropped pedestrian images. However, this process suffers from two types of detector errors: excessive background and part missing. Both errors deteriorate the quality of pedestrian alignment and may compromise pedestrian matching due to the position and scale variances. To address the misalignment problem, we propose that alignment be learned from an identification procedure. We introduce the pedestrian alignment network (PAN) which allows discriminative embedding learning pedestrian alignment without extra annotations. We observe that when the convolutional neural network learns to discriminate between different identities, the learned feature maps usually exhibit strong activations on the human body rather than the background. The proposed network thus takes advantage of this attention mechanism to adaptively locate and align pedestrians within a bounding box. Visual examples show that pedestrians are better aligned with PAN. Experiments on three large-scale re-ID datasets confirm that PAN improves the discriminative ability of the feature embeddings and yields competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art methods.

AB One of the most challenging research subjects in remote sensing is feature extraction, such as road features, from remote sensing images. Such an extraction influences multiple scenes, including map updating, traffic management, emergency tasks, road monitoring, and others. Therefore, a systematic review of deep learning techniques applied to common remote sensing benchmarks for road extraction is conducted in this study. The research is conducted based on four main types of deep learning methods, namely, the GANs model, deconvolutional networks, FCNs, and patch-based CNNs models. We also compare these various deep learning models applied to remote sensing datasets to show which method performs well in extracting road parts from high-resolution remote sensing images. Moreover, we describe future research directions and research gaps. Results indicate that the largest reported performance record is related to the deconvolutional nets applied to remote sensing images, and the F1 score metric of the generative adversarial network model, DenseNet method, and FCN-32 applied to UAV and Google Earth images are high: 96.08%, 95.72%, and 94.59%, respectively.

TI Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal
   Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Object detection; region proposal; convolutional neural network
AB State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet [1] and Fast R-CNN [2] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features-using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model [3], our detection system has a frame rate of 5 fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.

AB The purpose of this meta-analysis is to examine overall effect as well as the impact of selected instructional design principles in the context of virtual reality technology-based instruction (i.e. games, simulation, virtual worlds) in K-12 or higher education settings. A total of 13 studies (N = 3081) in the category of games, 29 studies (N = 2553) in the category of games, and 27 studies (N = 2798) in the category of virtual worlds were meta-analyzed. The key inclusion criteria were that the study came from K-12 or higher education settings, used experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, and used a learning outcome measure to evaluate the effects of the virtual reality-based instruction.
   Results suggest games (FEM = 0.77; REM = 0.51), simulations (FEM = 0.38; REM = 0.41), and virtual worlds (FEM = 036; REM = 0.41) were effective in improving learning outcome gains. The homogeneity analysis of the effect sizes was statistically significant, indicating that the studies were different from each other. Therefore, we conducted moderator analysis using 13 variables used to code the studies. Key findings included that: games show higher learning gains than simulations and virtual worlds. For simulation studies, elaborate explanation type feedback is more suitable for declarative tasks whereas knowledge of correct response is more appropriate for procedural tasks. Students performance is enhanced when they conduct the game play individually than in a group. In addition, we found an inverse relationship between number of treatment sessions learning gains for games.
   With regards to the virtual world, we found that if students were repeatedly measured it deteriorates their learning outcome gains. We discuss results to highlight the importance of considering instructional design principles when designing virtual reality-based instruction. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on mammograms enables early breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment. However, the accuracy of the existing CAD systems remains unsatisfactory. This paper explores a breast CAD method based on feature fusion with convolutional neural network (CNN) deep features. First, we propose a mass detection method based on CNN deep features and unsupervised extreme learning machine (ELM) clustering. Second, we build a feature set fusing deep features, morphological features, texture features, and density features. Third, an ELM classifier is developed using the fused feature set to classify benign and malignant breast masses. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed mass detection and breast cancer classification method.

AB Big data and artificial intelligence has revolutionized science in almost every field - from economics to physics. In the area of materials science and computational heterogeneous catalysis, this revolution has led to the development of scientific data repositories, as well as data mining and machine learning tools to investigate the vast materials space. The goal of using these tools is to establish a deeper understanding of the relations between materials properties and activity, selectivity and stability - the important figures of merit in catalysis. Based on these insights, catalyst design principles can be established, which hopefully lead us to discover highly efficient catalysts to solve pressing issues for a sustainable future and the synthesis of highly functional materials, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The inherent complexity of catalytic reactions quests for machine learning methods to efficiently navigate through the high-dimensional hyper-surfaces in structure optimization problems to determine relevant chemical structures and transition states. In this review, we show how cutting edge data infrastructures and machine learning methods are being used to address problems in computational heterogeneous catalysis.

AB Recent advances in machine learning have made significant contributions to drug discovery. Deep neural networks in particular have been demonstrated to provide significant boosts in predictive power when inferring the properties and activities of small-molecule compounds (Ma, J. et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015, 55, 263-274). However, the applicability of these techniques has been limited by the requirement for large amounts of training data. In this work, we demonstrate how one-shot learning can be used to significantly lower the amounts of data required to make meaningful predictions in drug discovery applications. We introduce a new architecture, the iterative refinement long short-term memory, that, when combined with graph convolutional neural networks, significantly improves learning of meaningful distance metrics over small-molecules. We open source all models introduced in this work as part of DeepChem, an open-source framework for deep-learning in drug discovery.

AB Given the advancements in modern technological capabilities, having an integrated health management and diagnostic strategy becomes an important part of a system's operational life-cycle. This is because it can be used to detect anomalies, analyse failures and predict the future state based on up-to-date information. By utilising condition data and on-site feedback, data models can be trained using machine learning and statistical concepts. Once trained, the logic for data processing can be embedded on on-board controllers whilst enabling real-time health assessment and analysis. However, this integration inevitably faces several difficulties and challenges for the community; indicating the need for novel approaches to address this vexing issue. Deep learning has gained increasing attention due to its potential advantages with data classification and feature extraction problems. It is an evolving research area with diverse application domains and hence its use for system health management applications must been researched if it can be used to increase overall system resilience or potential cost benefits for maintenance, repair, and overhaul activities. This article presents a systematic review of artificial intelligence based system health management with an emphasis on recent trends of deep learning within the field. Various architectures and related theories are discussed to clarify its potential. Based on the reviewed work, deep learning demonstrates plausible benefits for fault diagnosis and prognostics. However, there are a number of limitations that hinder its widespread adoption and require further development. Attention is paid to overcoming these challenges, with future opportunities being enumerated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing scene classification aims to assign automatically each aerial image a specific sematic label. In this letter, we propose a new method, called self-attention-based deep feature fusion (SAFF), to aggregate deep layer features and emphasize the weights of the complex objects of remote sensing scene images for remote sensing scene classification. First, the pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) model is applied to extract the abstract multilayer feature maps from the original aerial imagery. Then, a nonparametric self-attention layer is proposed for spatial-wise and channel-wise weightings, which enhances the effects of the spatial responses of the representative objects and uses the infrequently occurring features more sufficiently. Thus, it can extract more discriminative features. Finally, the aggregated features are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The proposed method is experimented on several data sets, and the results prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme for remote sensing scene classification.

AB Probabilistic forecasting, i.e., estimating a time series' future probability distribution given its past, is a key enabler for optimizing business processes. In retail businesses, for example, probabilistic demand forecasts are crucial for having the right inventory available at the right time and in the right place. This paper proposes DeepAR, a methodology for producing accurate probabilistic forecasts, based on training an autoregressive recurrent neural network model on a large number of related time series. We demonstrate how the application of deep learning techniques to forecasting can overcome many of the challenges that are faced by widely-used classical approaches to the problem. By means of extensive empirical evaluations on several real-world forecasting datasets, we show that our methodology produces more accurate forecasts than other state-of-the-art methods, while requiring minimal manual work.

AB With big data growth in biomedical and healthcare communities, accurate analysis of medical data benefits early disease detection, patient care, and community services. However, the analysis accuracy is reduced when the quality of medical data is incomplete. Moreover, different regions exhibit unique characteristics of certain regional diseases, which may weaken the prediction of disease outbreaks. In this paper, we streamline machine learning algorithms for effective prediction of chronic disease outbreak in disease-frequent communities. We experiment the modified prediction models over real-life hospital data collected from central China in 2013-2015. To overcome the difficulty of incomplete data, we use a latent factor model to reconstruct the missing data. We experiment on a regional chronic disease of cerebral infarction. We propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multimodal disease risk prediction algorithm using structured and unstructured data from hospital. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work focused on both data types in the area of medical big data analytics. Compared with several typical prediction algorithms, the prediction accuracy of our proposed algorithm reaches 94.8% with a convergence speed, which is faster than that of the CNN-based unimodal disease risk prediction algorithm.

AB Object-based image classification for land-cover mapping purposes using remote-sensing imagery has attracted significant attention in recent years. Numerous studies conducted over the past decade have investigated a broad array of sensors, feature selection, classifiers, and other factors of interest. However, these research results have not yet been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the effect of different supervised object-based land-cover classification processes. In this study, we first construct a database with 28 fields using qualitative and quantitative information extracted from 254 experimental cases described in 173 scientific papers. Second, the results of the meta-analysis are reported, including general characteristics of the studies (e.g., the geographic range of relevant institutes, preferred journals) and the relationships between factors of interest (e.g., spatial resolution and study area or optimal segmentation scale, accuracy and number of targeted classes), especially with respect to the classification accuracy of different sensors, segmentation scale, training set size, supervised classifiers, and land cover types. Third, useful data on supervised object-based image classification are determined from the meta-analysis. For example, we find that supervised object-based classification is currently experiencing rapid advances, while development of the fuzzy technique is limited in the object-based framework. Furthermore, spatial resolution correlates with the optimal segmentation scale and study area, and Random Forest (RF) shows the best performance in object-based classification. The area-based accuracy assessment method can obtain stable classification performance, and indicates a strong correlation between accuracy and training set size, while the accuracy of the point-based method is likely to be unstable due to mixed objects. In addition, the overall accuracy benefits from higher spatial resolution images (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle) or agricultural sites where it also correlates with the number of targeted classes. More than 95.6% of studies involve an area less than 300 ha, and the spatial resolution of images is predominantly between 0 and 2 m. Furthermore, we identify some methods that may advance supervised object-based image classification. For example, deep learning and type-2 fuzzy techniques may further improve classification accuracy. Lastly, scientists are strongly encouraged to report results of uncertainty studies to further explore the effects of varied factors on supervised object based image classification.

AB The constant need to increase agricultural production, together with the more and more frequent drought events in many areas of the world, requires a more careful assessment of irrigation needs and, therefore, a more accurate estimation of actual evapotranspiration. In recent years, several water management issues have been addressed by means of models derived from Artificial Intelligence research. When using machine learning based models, the main challenging aspects are represented by the choice of the best possible algorithm, the choice of adequately representative variables and the availability of appropriate data sets.
   Machine learning algorithms may be a powerful tool for the prediction of actual evapotranspiration, when a time series of few years is available. Starting from the measurements of a sufficient number of climatic parameters it is possible to obtain forecasting models characterized by very high accuracy and precision. Three different evapotranspiration models have been compared in this study. The models differ in the input variables. Four variants of each model were applied, varying the machine learning algorithm: M5P Regression Tree, Bagging, Random Forest and Support Vector Regression. The data refers to an experimental site in Central Florida, characterized by humid subtropical climate.
   The best outcomes have been provided by Model 1, whose input variables were net solar radiation, sensible-heat flux, moisture content of the soil, wind speed, mean relative humidity and mean temperature. Model 3, built from data only of mean temperature, mean relative humidity and net solar radiation, has provided still satisfactory results. Model 2, which adds the wind speed to the input variables of Model 3, has provided results that are absolutely comparable to those of Model 3 itself.

AB Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.

AB Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of "unrolling'' an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the "Vanilla LSTM''1 network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.

TI Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting
SO JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE neural networks; regularization; model combination; deep learning
AB Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different "thinned" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.

AB Advances in computer science and computational linguistics have yielded new, and faster, computational approaches to structuring and analyzing textual data. These approaches perform well on tasks like information extraction, but their ability to identify complex, socially constructed, and unsettled theoretical concepts-a central goal of sociological content analysis-has not been tested. To fill this gap, we compare the results produced by three common computer-assisted approaches-dictionary, supervised machine learning (SML), and unsupervised machine learning-to those produced through a rigorous hand-coding analysis of inequality in the news (N = 1,253 articles). Although we find that SML methods perform best in replicating hand-coded results, we document and clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, including how they can complement one another. We argue that content analysts in the social sciences would do well to keep all these approaches in their toolkit, deploying them purposefully according to the task at hand.

ID SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; SEGMENTATION
AB Background and objectives : Medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention problems are increasingly being addressed with deep-learning-based solutions. Established deep-learning platforms are flexible but do not provide specific functionality for medical image analysis and adapting them for this domain of application requires substantial implementation effort. Consequently, there has been substantial duplication of effort and incompatible infrastructure developed across many research groups. This work presents the open-source NiftyNet platform for deep learning in medical imaging. The ambition of NiftyNet is to accelerate and simplify the development of these solutions, and to provide a common mechanism for disseminating research outputs for the community to use, adapt and build upon.
   Methods : The NiftyNet infrastructure provides a modular deep-learning pipeline for a range of medical imaging applications including segmentation, regression, image generation and representation learning applications. Components of the NiftyNet pipeline including data loading, data augmentation, network architectures, loss functions and evaluation metrics are tailored to, and take advantage of, the idiosyncracies of medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention. NiftyNet is built on the TensorFlow framework and supports features such as TensorBoard visualization of 2D and 3D images and computational graphs by default.
   Results : We present three illustrative medical image analysis applications built using NiftyNet infrastructure: (1) segmentation of multiple abdominal organs from computed tomography; (2) image regression to predict computed tomography attenuation maps from brain magnetic resonance images; and (3) generation of simulated ultrasound images for specified anatomical poses.
   Conclusions : The NiftyNet infrastructure enables researchers to rapidly develop and distribute deep learning solutions for segmentation, regression, image generation and representation learning applications, or extend the platform to new applications.

AB Accurate road detection and centerline extraction from very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery are of central importance in a wide range of applications. Due to the complex backgrounds and occlusions of trees and cars, most road detection methods bring in the heterogeneous segments; besides for the centerline extraction task, most current approaches fail to extract a wonderful centerline network that appears smooth, complete, as well as single-pixel width. To address the above-mentioned complex issues, we propose a novel deep model, i.e., a cascaded end-to-end convolutional neural network (CasNet), to simultaneously cope with the road detection and centerline extraction tasks. Specifically, CasNet consists of two networks. One aims at the road detection task, whose strong representation ability is well able to tackle the complex backgrounds and occlusions of trees and cars. The other is cascaded to the former one, making full use of the feature maps produced formerly, to obtain the good centerline extraction. Finally, a thinning algorithm is proposed to obtain smooth, complete, and single-pixel width road centerline network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CasNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods greatly in learning quality and learning speed. That is, CasNet exceeds the comparing methods by a large margin in quantitative performance, and it is nearly 25 times faster than the comparing methods. Moreover, as another contribution, a large and challenging road centerline data set for the VHR remote sensing image will be publicly available for further studies.

The 2018 Contest addressed the problem of urban observation and monitoring with advanced multi-source optical remote sensing (multispectral LiDAR, hyperspectral imaging, and very high-resolution imagery). The competition was based on urban land use and land cover classification, aiming to distinguish between very diverse and detailed classes of urban objects, materials, and vegetation. Besides data fusion, it also quantified the respective assets of the novel sensors used to collect the data. Participants proposed elaborate approaches rooted in remote-sensing, and also in machine learning and computer vision, to make the most of the available data. Winning approaches combine convolutional neural networks with subtle earth-observation data scientist expertise.

AB Over the past few years, hyperspectral image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has progressed significantly. In spite of their effectiveness, given that hyperspectral images are of high dimensionality, CNNs can be hindered by their modeling of all spectral bands with the same weight, as probably not all bands are equally informative and predictive. Moreover, the usage of useless spectral bands in CNNs may even introduce noises and weaken the performance of networks. For the sake of boosting the representational capacity of CNNs for spectral-spatial hyperspectral data classification, in this work, we improve networks by discriminating the significance of different spectral bands. We design a network unit, which is termed as the spectral attention module, that makes use of a gating mechanism to adaptively recalibrate spectral bands by selectively emphasizing informative bands and suppressing less useful ones. We theoretically analyze and discuss why such a spectral attention module helps in a CNN for hyperspectral image classification. We demonstrate using extensive experiments that in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, the spectral attention module-based convolutional networks are able to offer competitive results. Furthermore, this work sheds light on how a CNN interacts with spectral bands for the purpose of classification.

AB This work presents a generic computer vision system designed for exploiting trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as a generic feature extractor and mixing these features with more traditional hand-crafted features. Such a system is a single structure that can be used for synthesizing a large number of different image classification tasks. Three substructures are proposed for creating the generic computer vision system starting from handcrafted and non-handcrafter features: i) one that remaps the output layer of a trained CNN to classify a different problem using an SVM; ii) a second for exploiting the output of the penultimate layer of a trained CNN as a feature vector to feed an SVM; and iii) a third for merging the output of some deep layers, applying a dimensionality reduction method, and using these features as the input to an SVM. The application of feature transform techniques to reduce the dimensionality of feature sets coming from the deep layers represents one of the main contributions of this paper. Three approaches are used for the non-handcrafted features: deep transfer learning features based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), principal component analysis network (PCAN), and the compact binary descriptor (CBD). For the handcrafted features, a wide variety of state-of-the-art algorithms are considered: Local Ternary Patterns, Local Phase Quantization, Rotation Invariant Co-occurrence Local Binary Patterns, Completed Local Binary Patterns, Rotated local binary pattern image, Globally Rotation Invariant Multi-scale Co-occurrence Local Binary Pattern, and several others. The computer vision system based on the proposed approach was tested on many different datasets, demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed approach thanks to the strong performance recorded. The Wilcoxon signed rank test is used to compare the different methods; moreover, the independence of the different methods is studied using the Q-statistic.

AB Robust and fast detection of anatomical structures is a prerequisite for both diagnostic and interventional medical image analysis. Current solutions for anatomy detection are typically based on machine learning techniques that exploit large annotated image databases in order to learn the appearance of the captured anatomy. These solutions are subject to several limitations, including the use of suboptimal feature engineering techniques and most importantly the use of computationally suboptimal search-schemes for anatomy detection. To address these issues, we propose a method that follows a new paradigm by reformulating the detection problem as a behavior learning task for an artificial agent. We couple the modeling of the anatomy appearance and the object search in a unified behavioral framework, using the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning and multi-scale image analysis. In other words, an artificial agent is trained not only to distinguish the target anatomical object from the rest of the body but also how to find the object by learning and following an optimal navigation path to the target object in the imaged volumetric space. We evaluated our approach on 1487 3D-CT volumes from 532 patients, totaling over 500,000 image slices and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions on detecting several anatomical structures with no failed cases from a clinical acceptance perspective, while also achieving a 20-30 percent higher detection accuracy. Most importantly, we improve the detection-speed of the reference methods by 2-3 orders of magnitude, achieving unmatched real-time performance on large 3D-CT scans.

AB It is expensive to obtain labeled real-world visual data for use in training of supervised algorithms. Therefore, it is valuable to leverage existing databases of labeled data. However, the data in the source databases is often obtained under conditions that differ from those in the new task. Transfer learning provides techniques for transferring learned knowledge from a source domain to a target domain by finding a mapping between them. In this paper, we discuss a method for projecting both source and target data to a generalized subspace where each target sample can be represented by some combination of source samples. By employing a low-rank constraint during this transfer, the structure of source and target domains are preserved. This approach has three benefits. First, good alignment between the domains is ensured through the use of only relevant data in some subspace of the source domain in reconstructing the data in the target domain. Second, the discriminative power of the source domain is naturally passed on to the target domain. Third, noisy information will be filtered out during knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, and important computer vision problems such as face recognition application and visual domain adaptation for object recognition demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the existing, well-established methods.

AB Aerial scene classification, which aims to automatically label an aerial image with a specific semantic category, is a fundamental problem for understanding high-resolution remote sensing imagery. In recent years, it has become an active task in the remote sensing area, and numerous algorithms have been proposed for this task, including many machine learning and data-driven approaches. However, the existing data sets for aerial scene classification, such as UC-Merced data set and WHU-RS19, contain relatively small sizes, and the results on them are already saturated. This largely limits the development of scene classification algorithms. This paper describes the Aerial Image data set (AID): a large-scale data set for aerial scene classification. The goal of AID is to advance the state of the arts in scene classification of remote sensing images. For creating AID, we collect and annotate more than 10 000 aerial scene images. In addition, a comprehensive review of the existing aerial scene classification techniques as well as recent widely used deep learning methods is given. Finally, we provide a performance analysis of typical aerial scene classification and deep learning approaches on AID, which can be served as the baseline results on this benchmark.

ID FEATURE-EXTRACTION; QUALITY ASSESSMENT; PERFORMANCE
AB In this paper, we propose a general image fusion framework based on the convolutional neural network, named as IFCNN. Inspired by the transform-domain image fusion algorithms, we firstly utilize two convolutional layers to extract the salient image features from multiple input images. Afterwards, the convolutional features of multiple input images are fused by an appropriate fusion rule (elementwise-max, elementwise-min or elementwise-mean), which is selected according to the type of input images. Finally, the fused features are reconstructed by two convolutional layers to produce the informative fusion image. The proposed model is fully convolutional, so it could be trained in the end-to-end manner without any post-processing procedures. In order to fully train the model, we have generated a large-scale multi-focus image dataset based on the large-scale RGB-D dataset (i.e., NYU-D2), which owns ground-truth fusion images and contains more diverse and larger images than the existing datasets for image fusion. Without finetuning on other types of image datasets, the experimental results show that the proposed model demonstrates better generalization ability than the existing image fusion models for fusing various types of images, such as multi-focus, infrared-visual, multi-modal medical and multi-exposure images. Moreover, the results also verify that our model has achieved comparable or even better results compared to the state-of-the-art image fusion algorithms on four types of image datasets.

AB This research paper estimates carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and vehicle -miles traveled (VMT) levels of two delivery models, one by trucks and the other by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or "drones." Using several ArcGIS tools and emission standards within a framework of logistical and operational assumptions, it has been found that emission results vary greatly and are highly dependent on the energy requirements of the drone, as well as the distance it must travel and the number of recipients it serves. Still, general conditions are identified under which drones are likely to provide a CO2 benefit - when service zones are close to the depot, have small numbers of stops, or both. Additionally, measures of VMT for both modes were found to be relatively consistent with existing literature that compares traditional passenger travel with truck delivery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has become a hot topic in the field of remote sensing. In general, the complex characteristics of hyperspectral data make the accurate classification of such data challenging for traditional machine learning methods. In addition, hyperspectral imaging often deals with an inherently nonlinear relation between the captured spectral information and the corresponding materials. In recent years, deep learning has been recognized as a powerful feature-extraction tool to effectively address nonlinear problems and widely used in a number of image processing tasks. Motivated by those successful applications, deep learning has also been introduced to classify HSIs and demonstrated good performance. This survey paper presents a systematic review of deep learning-based HSI classification literatures and compares several strategies for this topic. Specifically, we first summarize the main challenges of HSI classification which cannot be effectively overcome by traditional machine learning methods, and also introduce the advantages of deep learning to handle these problems. Then, we build a framework that divides the corresponding works into spectral-feature networks, spatial-feature networks, and spectral-spatial-feature networks to systematically review the recent achievements in deep learning-based HSI classification. In addition, considering the fact that available training samples in the remote sensing field are usually very limited and training deep networks require a large number of samples, we include some strategies to improve classification performance, which can provide some guidelines for future studies on this topic. Finally, several representative deep learning-based classification methods are conducted on real HSIs in our experiments.

AB Virtual reality (VR) is predicted to create a paradigm shift in education and training, but there is little empirical evidence of its educational value. The main objectives of this study were to determine the consequences of adding immersive VR to virtual learning simulations, and to investigate whether the principles of multimedia learning generalize to immersive VR. Furthermore, electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to obtain a direct measure of cognitive processing during learning. A sample of 52 university students participated in a 2 x 2 experimental cross-panel design wherein students learned from a science simulation via a desktop display (PC) or a head-mounted display (VR); and the simulations contained on-screen text or on-screen text with narration. Across both text versions, students reported being more present in the VR condition (d = 1.30); but they learned less (d = 0.80), and had significantly higher cognitive load based on the EEG measure (d = 0.59). In spite of its motivating properties (as reflected in presence ratings), learning science in VR may overload and distract the learner (as reflected in EEG measures of cognitive load), resulting in less opportunity to build learning outcomes (as reflected in poorer learning outcome test performance).

AB NASA's Kepler Space Telescope was designed to determine the frequency of Earth-sized planets orbiting Sun-like stars, but these planets are on the very edge of the mission's detection sensitivity. Accurately determining the occurrence rate of these planets will require automatically and accurately assessing the likelihood that individual candidates are indeed planets, even at low signal-to-noise ratios. We present a method for classifying potential planet signals using deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms that have recently become state-of-the-art in a wide variety of tasks. We train a deep convolutional neural network to predict whether a given signal is a transiting exoplanet or a false positive caused by astrophysical or instrumental phenomena. Our model is highly effective at ranking individual candidates by the likelihood that they are indeed planets: 98.8% of the time it ranks plausible planet signals higher than false-positive signals in our test set. We apply our model to a new set of candidate signals that we identified in a search of known Kepler multi-planet systems. We statistically validate two new planets that are identified with high confidence by our model. One of these planets is part of a five-planet resonant chain around Kepler-80, with an orbital period closely matching the prediction by three-body Laplace relations. The other planet orbits Kepler-90, a star that was previously known to host seven transiting planets. Our discovery of an eighth planet brings Kepler-90 into a tie with our Sun as the star known to host the most planets.

AB Virtual reality (VR) allows users to experience a sense of presence in a computer-generated, three-dimensional environment. Sensory information is delivered through a head-mounted display and specialized interface devices. These devices track head movements so that the movements and images change in a natural way with head motion, allowing for a sense of immersion. VR, which allows for controlled delivery of sensory stimulation via the therapist, is a convenient and cost-effective treatment. This review focuses on the available literature regarding the effectiveness of incorporating VR within the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, with particular attention to exposure-based intervention for anxiety disorders. A systematic literature search was conducted in order to identify studies implementing VR-based treatment for anxiety or other psychiatric disorders. This article reviews the history of the development of VR-based technology and its use within psychiatric treatment, the empirical evidence for VR-based treatment, and the benefits for using VR for psychiatric research and treatment. It also presents recommendations for how to incorporate VR into psychiatric care and discusses future directions for VR-based treatment and clinical research.

AB The field of sentiment analysis, in which sentiment is gathered, analyzed, and aggregated from text, has seen a lot of attention in the last few years. The corresponding growth of the field has resulted in the emergence of various subareas, each addressing a different level of analysis or research question. This survey focuses on aspect-level sentiment analysis, where the goal is to find and aggregate sentiment on entities mentioned within documents or aspects of them. An in-depth overview of the current state-of-the-art is given, showing the tremendous progress that has already been made in finding both the target, which can be an entity as such, or some aspect of it, and the corresponding sentiment. Aspect-level sentiment analysis yields very fine-grained sentiment information which can be useful for applications in various domains. Current solutions are categorized based on whether they provide a method for aspect detection, sentiment analysis, or both. Furthermore, a breakdown based on the type of algorithm used is provided. For each discussed study, the reported performance is included. To facilitate the quantitative evaluation of the various proposed methods, a call is made for the standardization of the evaluation methodology that includes the use of shared data sets. Semantically-rich concept-centric aspect-level sentiment analysis is discussed and identified as one of the most promising future research direction.

DT Article
ID COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; NOISE-REDUCTION
AB Reducing the radiation dose for medical CT scans can provide a less invasive imaging method, but requires a method for reconstructing an image up to the image quality from a full-dose scan. In this article, Wang and colleagues show that the deep learning approach, combined with the feedback from radiologists, produces higher quality reconstructions than or similar to that using the current commercial methods.
   Commercial iterative reconstruction techniques help to reduce the radiation dose of computed tomography (CT), but altered image appearance and artefacts can limit their adoptability and potential use. Deep learning has been investigated for low-dose CT (LDCT). Here, we design a modularized neural network for LDCT and compare it with commercial iterative reconstruction methods from three leading CT vendors. Although popular networks are trained for an end-to-end mapping, our network performs an end-to-process mapping so that intermediate denoised images are obtained with associated noise reduction directions towards a final denoised image. The learned workflow allows radiologists in the loop to optimize the denoising depth in a task-specific fashion. Our network was trained with the Mayo LDCT Dataset and tested on separate chest and abdominal CT exams from Massachusetts General Hospital. The best deep learning reconstructions were systematically compared to the best iterative reconstructions in a double-blinded reader study. This study confirms that our deep learning approach performs either favourably or comparably in terms of noise suppression and structural fidelity, and is much faster than commercial iterative reconstruction algorithms.

ID SUPPORT; SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION; MODEL
AB As an important part of solar power system, photovoltaic grid-connected system and solar thermal system, solar irradiance has the inherent characteristics of variability and uncertainty. Existing data analysis methods are difficult to demonstrate better generalization. Hence, resource planners must be adaptable to accommodate these uncertainties while conducting planning. To improve the accuracy of solar energy prediction and efficiently organize the utilization of solar energy, a novel convolutional neural networks framework has been constructed. Firstly, we have established a convolutional neural network framework for solar prediction based on meteorological data from surrounding sites and different sampling times. Secondly, the chaotic GA/PSO1 hybrid algorithm is applied to optimize the hyper parameters of the novel framework, which alleviates the imperfect performance caused by improper hyper parameters. At the meantime, the hybrid algorithm can reduce the manpower and resources of manual parameter adjustment. Excitability of the novel framework has been verified by benchmark tests. In the solar irradiance prediction studies, the annual average Mean Absolute Error of the proposed method is reduced by 0.1463 MJ.m(-2) compared with single CNN2 framework. The annual average Mean Absolute Error of the proposed method is reduced by 49.47%, 47.6%, 20.34%, respectively, compared with ANN(3), K-means-RBF4 and GBRT.(5) The superiority has been fully illustrated through all the simulation test results. Therefore, the proposed method provides a basis for accurate estimation of solar power, which can promote further development of the whole power system.

AB Virtual reality (VR) allows for the creation of ecological environments that could be used for cognitive assessment and intervention. This study comprises two parts that describe and assess an immersive VR task, theVirtual Shop, which can be used to measure episodic memory. Part 1 addresses its applicability in healthy older adults by measuring presence, motivation, and cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 addresses its construct validity by investigating correlations between performance in the VR task and on a traditional experimental memory task, and by measuring whether the VR task is sensitive to age-related memory differences. Fifty-seven older and 20 younger adults were assessed in theVirtual Shop, in which they memorised and fetched 12 familiar items. Part 1 showed high levels of presence, higher levels of motivation for the VR than for the traditional task, and negligible cybersickness symptoms. Part 2 indicates that memory performance in the VR task is positively correlated with performance on a traditional memory task for both age groups, and age-related differences were found on the VR and traditional memory tasks. Thus, the use of VR is feasible in older adults and theVirtual Shopis a valid task to assess and train episodic memory in this population.

AB Discovery and development of biopeptides are time-consuming, laborious, and dependent on various factors. Data-driven computational methods, especially machine learning (ML) approach, can rapidly and efficiently predict the utility of therapeutic peptides. ML methods offer an array of tools that can accelerate and enhance decision making and discovery for well-defined queries with ample and sophisticated data quality. Various ML approaches, such as support vector machines, random forest, extremely randomized tree, and more recently deep learning methods, are useful in peptide-based drug discovery. These approaches leverage the peptide data sets, created via high-throughput sequencing and computational methods, and enable the prediction of functional peptides with increased levels of accuracy. The use of ML approaches in the development of peptide-based therapeutics is relatively recent; however, these techniques are already revolutionizing protein research by unraveling their novel therapeutic peptide functions. In this review, we discuss several ML-based state-of-the-art peptide-prediction tools and compare these methods in terms of their algorithms, feature encodings, prediction scores, evaluation methodologies, and software utilities. We also assessed the prediction performance of these methods using well-constructed independent data sets. In addition, we discuss the common pitfalls and challenges of using ML approaches for peptide therapeutics. Overall, we show that using ML models in peptide research can streamline the development of targeted peptide therapies.

AB The access security of wireless devices is a serious challenge in present wireless network security. Radio frequency (RF) fingerprint recognition technology as an important non-password authentication technology attracts more and more attention, because of its full use of radio frequency characteristics that cannot be imitated to achieve certification. In this paper, a RF fingerprint identification method based on dimensional reduction and machine learning is proposed as a component of intrusion detection for resolving authentication security issues. We compare three kinds of dimensional reduction methods, which are the traditional PCA, RPCA and KPCA. And we take random forests, support vector machine, artificial neural network and grey correlation analysis into consideration to make decisions on the dimensional reduction data. Finally, we obtain the recognition system with the best performance. Using a combination of RPCA and random forests, we achieve 90% classification accuracy is achieved at SNR10dB when reduced dimension is 76. The proposed method improves wireless device authentication and improves security protection due to the introduction of RF fingerprinting.

AB With the rapid development of Internet of things devices and network infrastructure, there have been a lot of sensors adopted in the industrial productions, resulting in a large size of data. One of the most popular examples is the manufacture inspection, which is to detect the defects of the products. In order to implement a robust inspection system with higher accuracy, we propose a deep learning based classification model in this paper, which can find the possible defective products. As there may be many assembly lines in one factory, one huge problem in this scenario is how to process such big data in real time. Therefore, we design our system with the concept of fog computing. By offloading the computation burden from the central server to the fog nodes, the system obtains the ability to deal with extremely large data. There are two obvious advantages in our system. The first one is that we adapt the convolutional neural network model to the fog computing environment, which significantly improves its computing efficiency. The other one is that we work out an inspection model, which can simultaneously indicate the defect type and its degree. The experiments well prove that the proposed method is robust and efficient.

AB The development of light detection and ranging, Radar, camera, and other advanced sensor technologies inaugurated a new era in autonomous driving. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of these sensors, autonomous vehicles are prone to making erroneous decisions and causing serious disasters. At this point, networking and communication technologies can greatly make up for sensor deficiencies, and are more reliable, feasible and efficient to promote the information interaction, thereby improving autonomous vehicle's perception and planning capabilities as well as realizing better vehicle control. This paper surveys the networking and communication technologies in autonomous driving from two aspects: intra- and inter-vehicle. The intra-vehicle network as the basis of realizing autonomous driving connects the on-hoard electronic parts. The inter-vehicle network is the medium for interaction between vehicles and outside information. In addition, we present the new trends of communication technologies in autonomous driving, as well as investigate the current mainstream verification methods and emphasize the challenges and open issues of networking and communications in autonomous driving.

TI Development and Validation of a Deep Learning Algorithm for Detection of
   Diabetic Retinopathy in Retinal Fundus Photographs
SO JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
ID IMAGES
AB IMPORTANCE Deep learning is a family of computational methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set of examples that demonstrate the desired behavior, removing the need to specify rules explicitly. Application of these methods to medical imaging requires further assessment and validation.
   OBJECTIVE To apply deep learning to create an algorithm for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs.
   DESIGN AND SETTING A specific type of neural network optimized for image classification called a deep convolutional neural network was trained using a retrospective development data set of 128 175 retinal images, which were graded 3 to 7 times for diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image gradability by a panel of 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology senior residents between May and December 2015. The resultant algorithm was validated in January and February 2016 using 2 separate data sets, both graded by at least 7 US board-certified ophthalmologists with high intragrader consistency.
   EXPOSURE Deep learning-trained algorithm.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy (RDR), defined as moderate and worse diabetic retinopathy, referable diabetic macular edema, or both, were generated based on the reference standard of the majority decision of the ophthalmologist panel. The algorithm was evaluated at 2 operating points selected from the development set, one selected for high specificity and another for high sensitivity.
   RESULTS The EyePACS-1 data set consisted of 9963 images from 4997 patients (mean age, 54.4 years; 62.2% women; prevalence of RDR, 683/8878 fully gradable images [7.8%]); the Messidor-2 data set had 1748 images from 874 patients (mean age, 57.6 years; 42.6% women; prevalence of RDR, 254/1745 fully gradable images [14.6%]). For detecting RDR, the algorithm had an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.991 (95% CI, 0.988-0.993) for EyePACS-1 and 0.990(95% CI, 0.986-0.995) for Messidor-2. Using the first operating cut point with high specificity, for EyePACS-1, the sensitivity was 90.3%(95% CI, 87.5%-92.7%) and the specificity was 98.1%(95% CI, 97.8%-98.5%). For Messidor-2, the sensitivity was 87.0%(95% CI, 81.1%-91.0%) and the specificity was 98.5%(95% CI, 97.7%-99.1%). Using a second operating point with high sensitivity in the development set, for EyePACS-1 the sensitivity was 97.5% and specificity was 93.4% and for Messidor-2 the sensitivity was 96.1% and specificity was 93.9%.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this evaluation of retinal fundus photographs from adults with diabetes, an algorithm based on deep machine learning had high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy. Further research is necessary to determine the feasibility of applying this algorithm in the clinical setting and to determine whether use of the algorithm could lead to improved care and outcomes compared with current ophthalmologic assessment.

AB The increasing application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in health and medicine has attracted a great deal of research interest in recent decades. This study aims to provide a global and historical picture of research concerning AI in health and medicine. A total of 27,451 papers that were published between 1977 and 2018 (84.6% were dated 2008-2018) were retrieved from the Web of Science platform. The descriptive analysis examined the publication volume, and authors and countries collaboration. A global network of authors' keywords and content analysis of related scientific literature highlighted major techniques, including Robotic, Machine learning, Artificial neural network, Artificial intelligence, Natural language process, and their most frequent applications in Clinical Prediction and Treatment. The number of cancer-related publications was the highest, followed by Heart Diseases and Stroke, Vision impairment, Alzheimer's, and Depression. Moreover, the shortage in the research of AI application to some high burden diseases suggests future directions in AI research. This study offers a first and comprehensive picture of the global efforts directed towards this increasingly important and prolific field of research and suggests the development of global and national protocols and regulations on the justification and adaptation of medical AI products.

AB Street scene understanding is an essential task for autonomous driving. One important step toward this direction is scene labeling, which annotates each pixel in the images with a correct class label. Although many approaches have been developed, there are still some weak points. First, many methods are based on the hand-crafted features whose image representation ability is limited. Second, they cannot label foreground objects accurately due to the data set bias. Third, in the refinement stage, the traditional Markov random filed inference is prone to over smoothness. For improving the above problems, this paper proposes a joint method of priori convolutional neural networks at superpixel level (called as "priori s-CNNs") and soft restricted context transfer. Our contributions are threefold: 1) a priori s-CNNs model that learns priori location information at superpixel level is proposed to describe various objects discriminatingly; 2) a hierarchical data augmentation method is presented to alleviate data set bias in the priori s-CNNs training stage, which improves foreground objects labeling significantly; and 3) a soft restricted MRF energy function is defined to improve the priori s-CNNs model's labeling performance and reduce the over smoothness at the same time. The proposed approach is verified on CamVid data set (11 classes) and SIFT Flow Street data set (16 classes) and achieves a competitive performance.

AB Humans and animals have the ability to continually acquire, fine-tune, and transfer knowledge and skills throughout their lifespan. This ability, referred to as lifelong learning, is mediated by a rich set of neurocognitive mechanisms that together contribute to the development and specialization of our sensorimotor skills as well as to long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. Consequently, lifelong learning capabilities are crucial for computational learning systems and autonomous agents interacting in the real world and processing continuous streams of information. However, lifelong learning remains a long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural network models since the continual acquisition of incrementally available information from non-stationary data distributions generally leads to catastrophic forgetting or interference. This limitation represents a major drawback for state-of-the-art deep neural network models that typically learn representations from stationary batches of training data, thus without accounting for situations in which information becomes incrementally available over time. In this review, we critically summarize the main challenges linked to lifelong learning for artificial learning systems and compare existing neural network approaches that alleviate, to different extents, catastrophic forgetting. Although significant advances have been made in domain-specific learning with neural networks, extensive research efforts are required for the development of robust lifelong learning on autonomous agents and robots. We discuss well-established and emerging research motivated by lifelong learning factors in biological systems such as structural plasticity, memory replay, curriculum and transfer learning, intrinsic motivation, and multisensory integration.

AB Nowadays, consumers are paying great attention to the characteristics of food such as smell, taste, and appearance. This motivates scientists to imitate human senses using devices known as electronic senses. These include electronic noses, electronic tongues, and computer vision. Thanks to the utilization of various sensors and methods of signal analysis, artificial senses are widely applied in food analysis for process monitoring and determining the quality and authenticity of foods. This paper summarizes achievements in the field of artificial senses. It includes a brief history of these systems, descriptions of most commonly used sensors (conductometric, potentiometric, amperometic/voltarnmetric, impedimetric, colorimetric, piezoelectric), data analysis methods (for example, artificial neural network (ANN), principal component analysis (PCA), model CIE L*a*b*), and application of artificial senses to food analysis, in particular quality control, authenticity and falsification assessment, and monitoring of production processes.

AB In recent years, there has been a proliferation of works on human action classification from depth sequences. These works generally present methods and/or feature representations for the classification of actions from sequences of 3D locations of human body joints and/or other sources of data, such as depth maps and RGB videos.
   This survey highlights motivations and challenges of this very recent research area by presenting technologies and approaches for 3D skeleton-based action classification. The work focuses on aspects such as data pre-processing, publicly available benchmarks and commonly used accuracy measurements. Furthermore, this survey introduces a categorization of the most recent works in 3D skeleton-based action classification according to the adopted feature representation.
   This paper aims at being a starting point for practitioners who wish to approach the study of 3D action classification and gather insights on the main challenges to solve in this emerging field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE High efficiency video coding; in-loop filter; deep learning; multiple

ID VIDEO SUPERRESOLUTION; MOTION COMPENSATION; EFFICIENCY; MODEL
AB An extensive study on the in-loop filter has been proposed for a high efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard to reduce compression artifacts, thus improving coding efficiency. However, in the existing approaches, the in-loop filter is always applied to each single frame, without exploiting the content correlation among multiple frames. In this paper, we propose a multi-frame in-loop filter (MIF) for HEVC, which enhances the visual quality of each encoded frame by leveraging its adjacent frames. Specifically, we first construct a large-scale database containing encoded frames and their corresponding raw frames of a variety of content, which can he used to learn the in-loop filter in HEVC. Furthermore, we find that there usually exist a number of reference frames of higher quality and of similar content for an encoded frame. Accordingly, a reference frame selector (RFS) is designed to identify these frames. Then, a deep neural network for MIF (known as MIF-Net) is developed to enhance the quality of each encoded frame by utilizing the spatial information of this frame and the temporal information of its neighboring higher-quality frames. The MIF-Net is built on the recently developed DenseNet, benefiting from its improved generalization capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a novel block-adaptive convolutional layer is designed and applied in the MIF-Net, for handling the artifacts influenced by coding tree unit (CTU) structure in HEVC. Extensive experiments show that our MIF approach achieves on average 11.621% saving of the Bjontegaard delta bit-rate (BD-BR) on the standard test set, significantly outperforming the standard in-loop filter in HEVC and other state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Objective: The focal length of available optical see-through (OST) head-mounted displays (HMDs) is at least 2& x00A0;m; therefore, during manual tasks, the user eye cannot keep in focus both the virtual and real content at the same time. Another perceptual limitation is related to the vergence-accommodation conflict, the latter being present in binocular vision only. This paper investigates the effect of incorrect focus cues on the user performance, visual comfort, and workload during the execution of augmented reality (AR)-guided manual task with one of the most advanced OST HMD, the Microsoft HoloLens. Methods: An experimental study was designed to investigate the performance of 20 subjects in a connect-the-dots task, with and without the use of AR. The following tests were planned: AR-guided monocular and binocular, and naked-eye monocular and binocular. Each trial was analyzed to evaluate the accuracy in connecting dots. NASA Task Load Index and Likert questionnaires were used to assess the workload and the visual comfort. Results: No statistically significant differences were found in the workload, and in the perceived comfort between the AR-guided binocular and monocular test. User performances were significantly better during the naked eye tests. No statistically significant differences in performances were found in the monocular and binocular tests. The maximum error in AR tests was 5.9& x00A0;mm. Conclusion: Even if there is a growing interest in using commercial OST HMD, for guiding high-precision manual tasks, attention should be paid to the limitations of the available technology not designed for the peripersonal space.

AB Accurate prediction of traffic information (i.e., traffic flow, travel time, traffic speed, etc.) is a key component of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Traffic speed is an important indicator to evaluate traffic efficiency. Up to date, although a few studies have considered the periodic feature in traffic prediction, very few studies comprehensively evaluate the impact of periodic component on statistical and machine learning prediction models. This paper selects several representative statistical models and machine learning models to analyze the influence of periodic component on short-term speed prediction under different scenarios: (1) multi-horizon ahead prediction (5, 15, 30, 60 minutes ahead predictions), (2) with and without periodic component, (3) two data aggregation levels (5-minute and 15-minute), (4) peak hours and off-peak hours. Specifically, three statistical models (i.e., space time (ST) model, vector autoregressive (VAR) model, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model) and three machine learning approaches (i.e., support vector machines (SVM) model, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, recurrent neural network (RNN) model) are developed and examined. Furthermore, the periodic features of the speed data are considered via a hybrid prediction method, which assumes that the data consist of two components: a periodic component and a residual component. The periodic component is described by a trigonometric regression function, and the residual component is modeled by the statistical models or the machine learning approaches. The important conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) the multi-step ahead prediction accuracy improves when considering the periodic component of speed data for both three statistical models and three machine learning models, especially in the peak hours; (2) considering the impact of periodic component for all models, the prediction performance improvement gradually becomes larger as the time step increases; (3) under the same prediction horizon, the prediction performance of all models for 15-minute speed data is generally better than that for 5-minute speed data. Overall, the findings in this paper suggest that the proposed hybrid prediction approach is effective for both statistical and machine learning models in short-term speed prediction.

AB We describe a learning-based approach to hand-eye coordination for robotic grasping from monocular images. To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images independent of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. We describe two large-scale experiments that we conducted on two separate robotic platforms. In the first experiment, about 800,000 grasp attempts were collected over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and gripper wear and tear. In the second experiment, we used a different robotic platform and 8 robots to collect a dataset consisting of over 900,000 grasp attempts. The second robotic platform was used to test transfer between robots, and the degree to which data from a different set of robots can be used to aid learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing. Our transfer experiment also illustrates that data from different robots can be combined to learn more reliable and effective grasping.

AB Nuclear segmentation in digital microscopic tissue images can enable extraction of high-quality features for nuclear morphometrics and other analysis in computational pathology. Conventional image processing techniques, such as Otsu thresholding and watershed segmentation, do not work effectively on challenging cases, such as chromatin-sparse and crowded nuclei. In contrast, machine learning-based segmentation can generalize across various nuclear appearances. However, training machine learning algorithms requires data sets of images, in which a vast number of nuclei have been annotated. Publicly accessible and annotated data sets, along with widely agreed upon metrics to compare techniques, have catalyzed tremendous innovation and progress on other image classification problems, particularly in object recognition. Inspired by their success, we introduce a large publicly accessible data set of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue images with more than 21 000 painstakingly annotated nuclear boundaries, whose quality was validated by a medical doctor. Because our data set is taken from multiple hospitals and includes a diversity of nuclear appearances from several patients, disease states, and organs, techniques trained on it are likely to generalize well and work right out-of-the-box on other H&E-stained images. We also propose a new metric to evaluate nuclear segmentation results that penalizes object-and pixel-level errors in a unified manner, unlike previous metrics that penalize only one type of error. We also propose a segmentation technique based on deep learning that lays a special emphasis on identifying the nuclear boundaries, including those between the touching or overlapping nuclei, and works well on a diverse set of test images.

AB We present a supervised learning approach to predict the products of organic reactions given their reactants, reagents, and solvent(s). The prediction task is factored into two stages comparable to manual expert approaches: considering possible sites of reactivity and evaluating their relative likelihoods. By training on hundreds of thousands of reaction precedents covering a broad range of reaction types from the patent literature, the neural model makes informed predictions of chemical reactivity. The model predicts the major product correctly over 85% of the time requiring around 100 ms per example, a significantly higher accuracy than achieved by previous machine learning approaches, and performs on par with expert chemists with years of formal training. We gain additional insight into predictions via the design of the neural model, revealing an understanding of chemistry qualitatively consistent with manual approaches.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid text classification model based on deep belief network and softmax regression. To solve the sparse high-dimensional matrix computation problem of texts data, a deep belief network is introduced. After the feature extraction with DBN, softmax regression is employed to classify the text in the learned feature space. In pre-training procedures, the deep belief network and softmax regression are first trained, respectively. Then, in the fine-tuning stage, they are transformed into a coherent whole and the system parameters are optimized with Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. The experimental results on Reuters-21,578 and 20-Newsgroup corpus show that the proposed model can converge at fine-tuning stage and perform significantly better than the classical algorithms, such as SVM and KNN.

AB Computational approaches to drug discovery can reduce the time and cost associated with experimental assays and enable the screening of novel chemotypes. Structure-based drug design methods rely on scoring functions to rank and predict binding affinities and poses. The everexpanding amount of protein ligand binding and structural data enables the use of deep machine learning techniques for protein ligand scoring. We describe convolutional neural network (CNN) scoring functions that take as input a comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) representation of a protein ligand interaction. A CNN scoring function automatically learns the key features of protein ligand interactions that correlate with binding. We train and optimize our CNN scoring functions to discriminate between correct and incorrect binding poses and known binders and nonbinders. We find that our CNN scoring function outperforms the AutoDock Vina scoring function when ranking poses both for pose prediction and virtual screening.

AB Members on both sides of the sharing economy transaction must trust each other to act in good faith. This study empirically investigates the effect of online review contents on potential guests' trust perceptions in AirBnB.com. Six thematic characteristics of accommodation experiences were found as salient themes from online review contents, and corresponding relationships regarding trust perceptions were investigated: Through content analysis and theme extraction in python, our results show the salient cognitive themes are room aesthetics, host attributes, location, repurchase intention, overall evaluation and room description. Trust perceptions were both evaluated by individual coders and predicted by a convolutional neural network. Results suggest salient themes determine trust perception: Host attributes positively lead to benevolence, location and room aesthetics positively affect ability, room description positively affects integrity, and location and host attributes determine overall trust perception.

AB The automated interpretation of rock structure can improve the efficiency, accuracy, and consistency of the geological risk assessment of tunnel face. Because of the high uncertainties in the geological images as a result of different regional rock types, as well as in-situ conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, and construction procedure), previous automated methods have limited performance in classification of rock structure of tunnel face during construction. This paper presents a framework for classifying multiple rock structures based on the geological images of tunnel face using convolutional neural networks (CNN), namely Inception-ResNet-V2 (IRV2). A prototype recognition system is implemented to classify 5 types of rock structures including mosaic, granular, layered, block, and fragmentation structures. The proposed IRV2 network is trained by over 35,000 out of 42,400 images extracted from over 150 sections of tunnel faces and tested by the remaining 7400 images. Furthermore, different hyperparameters of the CNN model are introduced to optimize the most efficient algorithm parameter. Among all the discussed models, i.e., ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and Inception-v4, Inception-ResNet-V2 exhibits the best performance in terms of various indicators, such as precision, recall, F-score, and testing time per image. Meanwhile, the model trained by a large database can obtain the object features more comprehensively, leading to higher accuracy. Compared with the original image classification method, the sub-image method is closer to the reality considering both the accuracy and the perspective of error divergence. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is optimal and efficient for automated classification of rock structure using the geological images of the tunnel face.

TI Transfer Learning With Neural Networks for Bearing Fault Diagnosis in

SO IEEE ACCESS

ID DECOMPOSITION; MODEL
AB Traditional machine learning algorithms have made great achievements in data-driven fault diagnosis. However, they assume that all the data must be in the same working condition and have the same distribution and feature space. They are not applicable for real-world working conditions, which often change with time, so the data are hard to obtain. In order to utilize data in different working conditions to improve the performance, this paper presents a transfer learning approach for fault diagnosis with neural networks. First, it learns characteristics from massive source data and adjusts the parameters of neural networks accordingly. Second, the structure of neural networks alters for the change of data distribution. In the same time, some parameters are transferred from source task to target task. Finally, the new model is trained by a small amount of target data in another working condition. The Case Western Reserve University bearing data set is used to validate the performance of the proposed transfer learning approach. Experimental results show that the proposed transfer learning approach can improve the classification accuracy and reduce the training time comparing with the conventional neural network method when there are only a small amount of target data.

AB Recommender system is a specific type of intelligent systems, which exploits historical user ratings on items and/or auxiliary information to make recommendations on items to the users. It plays a critical role in a wide range of online shopping, e-commercial services and social networking applications. Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular approaches used for recommender systems, but it suffers from complete cold start (CCS) problem where no rating record are available and incomplete cold start (ICS) problem where only a small number of rating records are available for some new items or users in the system. In this paper, we propose two recommendation models to solve the CCS and ICS problems for new items, which are based on a framework of tightly coupled CF approach and deep learning neural network. A specific deep neural network SADE is used to extract the content features of the items. The state of the art CF model, timeSVD++, which models and utilizes temporal dynamics of user preferences and item features, is modified to take the content features into prediction of ratings for cold start items. Extensive experiments on a large Netflix rating dataset of movies are performed, which show that our proposed recommendation models largely outperform the baseline models for rating prediction of cold start items. The two proposed recommendation models are also evaluated and compared on ICS items, and a flexible scheme of model retraining and switching is proposed to deal with the transition of items from cold start to non-cold start status. The experiment results on Netflix movie recommendation show the tight coupling of CF approach and deep learning neural network is feasible and very effective for cold start item recommendation. The design is general and can be applied to many other recommender systems for online shopping and social networking applications. The solution of cold start item problem can largely improve user experience and trust of recommender systems, and effectively promote cold start items. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVES The study evaluated the automatic prediction of obstructive disease from myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) by deep learning as compared with total perfusion deficit (TPD).
   BACKGROUND Deep convolutional neural networks trained with a large multicenter population may provide improved prediction of per-patient and per-vessel coronary artery disease from single-photon emission computed tomography MPI.
   METHODS A total of 1,638 patients (67% men) without known coronary artery disease, undergoing stress Tc-99m-ses-tamibi or tetrofosmin MPI with new generation solid-state scanners in 9 different sites, with invasive coronary angiography performed within 6 months of MPI, were studied. Obstructive disease was defined as >= 70% narrowing of coronary arteries (>= 50% for left main artery). Left ventricular myocardium was segmented using clinical nuclear cardiology software and verified by an expert reader. Stress TPD was computed using sex-and camera-specific normal limits. Deep learning was trained using raw and quantitative polar maps and evaluated for prediction of obstructive stenosis in a stratified 10-fold cross-validation procedure.
   RESULTS A total of 1,018 (62%) patients and 1,797 of 4,914 (37%) arteries had obstructive disease. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for disease prediction by deep learning was higher than for TPD (per patient: 0.80 vs. 0.78; per vessel: 0.76 vs. 0.73: p < 0.01). With deep learning threshold set to the same specificity as TPD, per-patient sensitivity improved from 79.8% (TPD) to 82.3% (deep learning) (p < 0.05), and per-vessel sensitivity improved from 64.4% (TPD) to 69.8% (deep learning) (p < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS Deep learning has the potential to improve automatic interpretation of MPI as compared with current clinical methods. (C) 2018 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

TI PhaseStain: the digital staining of label-free quantitative phase

AB Using a deep neural network, we demonstrate a digital staining technique, which we term PhaseStain, to transform the quantitative phase images (QPI) of label-free tissue sections into images that are equivalent to the brightfield microscopy images of the same samples that are histologically stained. Through pairs of image data (QPI and the corresponding brightfield images, acquired after staining), we train a generative adversarial network and demonstrate the effectiveness of this virtual-staining approach using sections of human skin, kidney, and liver tissue, matching the brightfield microscopy images of the same samples stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, Jones' stain, and Masson's trichrome stain, respectively. This digital-staining framework may further strengthen various uses of label-free QPI techniques in pathology applications and biomedical research in general, by eliminating the need for histological staining, reducing sample preparation related costs and saving time. Our results provide a powerful example of some of the unique opportunities created by data-driven image transformations enabled by deep learning.

AB Smart cities are aimed to efficiently manage growing urbanization, energy consumption, maintain a green environment, improve the economic and living standards of their citizens, and raise the people's capabilities to efficiently use and adopt the modern information and communication technology (ICT). In the smart cities concept, ICT is playing a vital role in policy design, decision, implementation, and ultimate productive services. The primary objective of this review is to explore the role of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in the evolution of smart cities. The preceding techniques are efficiently used to design optimal policy regarding various smart city-oriented complex problems. In this survey, we present in-depth details of the applications of the prior techniques in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), cyber-security, energy-efficient utilization of smart grids (SGs), effective use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assure the best services of 5G and beyond 5G (B5G) communications, and smart health care system in a smart city. Finally, we present various research challenges and future research directions where the aforementioned techniques can play an outstanding role to realize the concept of a smart city.

ID SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; SEGMENTATION; PERFORMANCE; IMAGES
AB We introduce DeepNAT, a 3D Deep convolutional neural network for the automatic segmentation of NeuroAnaTomy in Tl-weighted magnetic resonance images. DeepNAT is an end-to-end learning-based approach to brain segmentation that jointly learns an abstract feature representation and a multi-class classification. We propose a 3D patch-based approach, where we do not only predict the center voxel of the patch but also neighbors, which is formulated as multi-task learning. To address a class imbalance problem, we arrange two networks hierarchically, where the first one separates foreground from background, and the second one identifies 25 brain structures on the foreground. Since patches lack spatial context, we augment them with coordinates. To this end, we introduce a novel intrinsic parameterization of the brain volume, formed by eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As network architecture, we use three convolutional layers with pooling, batch normalization, and non-linearities, followed by fully connected layers with dropout. The final segmentation is inferred from the probabilistic output of the network with a 3D fully connected conditional random field, which ensures label agreement between close voxels. The roughly 2.7 million parameters in the network are learned with stochastic gradient descent. Our results show that DeepNAT compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the purely learning-based method may have a high potential for the adaptation to young, old, or diseased brains by fine-tuning the pre-trained network with a small training sample on the target application, where the availability of larger datasets with manual annotations may boost the overall segmentation accuracy in the future.

AB Building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images is of great significance in urban planning, population statistics, and economic forecast. However, automatic building extraction from high-resolution remote sensing images remains challenging. On the one hand, the extraction results of buildings are partially missing and incomplete due to the variation of hue and texture within a building, especially when the building size is large. On the other hand, the building footprint extraction of buildings with complex shapes is often inaccurate. To this end, we propose a new deep learning network, termed Building Residual Refine Network (BRRNet), for accurate and complete building extraction. BRRNet consists of such two parts as the prediction module and the residual refinement module. The prediction module based on an encoder-decoder structure introduces atrous convolution of different dilation rates to extract more global features, by gradually increasing the receptive field during feature extraction. When the prediction module outputs the preliminary building extraction results of the input image, the residual refinement module takes the output of the prediction module as an input. It further refines the residual between the result of the prediction module and the real result, thus improving the accuracy of building extraction. In addition, we use Dice loss as the loss function during training, which effectively alleviates the problem of data imbalance and further improves the accuracy of building extraction. The experimental results on Massachusetts Building Dataset show that our method outperforms other five state-of-the-art methods in terms of the integrity of buildings and the accuracy of complex building footprints.

AB Farm dams are a ubiquitous limnological feature of agricultural landscapes worldwide. While their primary function is to capture and store water, they also have disproportionally large effects on biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling, with important relevance to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the abundance and distribution of farm dams is unknown in most parts of the world. Therefore, we used artificial intelligence and remote sensing data to address this critical global information gap. Specifically, we trained a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) on high-definition satellite images to detect farm dams and carry out the first continental-scale assessment on density, distribution and historical trends. We found that in Australia there are 1.765 million farm dams that occupy an area larger than Rhode Island (4678 km(2)) and store over 20 times more water than Sydney Harbour (10,990 GL). The State of New South Wales recorded the highest number of farm dams (654,983; 37% of the total) and Victoria the highest overall density (1.73 dams km(-2)). We also estimated that 202,119 farm dams (11.5%) remain omitted from any maps, especially in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Three decades of historical records revealed an ongoing decrease in the construction rate of farm dams, from >3% per annum before 2000, to similar to 1% after 2000, to <0.05% after 2010-except in the Australian Capital Territory where rates have remained relatively high. We also found systematic trends in construction design: farm dams built in 2015 are on average 50% larger in surface area and contain 66% more water than those built in 1989. To facilitate sharing information on sustainable farm dam management with authorities, scientists, managers and local communities, we developed AusDams.org-a free interactive portal to visualise and generate statistics on the physical, environmental and ecological impacts of farm dams.

AB The histological analysis of tissue samples, widely used for disease diagnosis, involves lengthy and laborious tissue preparation. Here, we show that a convolutional neural network trained using a generative adversarial-network model can transform wide-field autofluorescence images of unlabelled tissue sections into images that are equivalent to the bright-field images of histologically stained versions of the same samples. A blind comparison, by board-certified pathologists, of this virtual staining method and standard histological staining using microscopic images of human tissue sections of the salivary gland, thyroid, kidney, liver and lung, and involving different types of stain, showed no major discordances. The virtual-staining method bypasses the typically labour-intensive and costly histological staining procedures, and could be used as a blueprint for the virtual staining of tissue images acquired with other label-free imaging modalities.

AB The existing cultural heritage mapping in Norway is incomplete. Some selected areas are mapped well, while the majority of areas only contain chance discoveries, often with bad positional accuracy. The goal of this research was to develop automated tools for improving the cultural heritage mapping in Norway, thus enabling detailed mapping of large areas within realistic budgets and time frames. The focus was on three types of cultural heritage that occur frequently in many types of Norwegian landscape: grave mounds, pitfall traps in deer hunting systems and charcoal kilns.
   A recent development in deep neural networks for object detection in natural images is the region-proposing convolutional neural network (R-CNN), which may also be used for cultural heritage detection in local relief model (LRM) visualizations of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Python code for 'Simple Faster R-CNN' was downloaded from Github.
   On 737 test images (16.6 km(2)) not seen during training, 87 % of the true cultural heritage objects were correctly identified, while 24 % of the predicted cultural heritage locations were false. However, all test images were small (150 m x 150 m) and contained at least one cultural heritage object, meaning that the false positive rate may be higher for an entire landscape. In Larvik municipality, Vestfold and Telemark County, on a 67 km(2) area not seen during training, the R-CNN correctly identified 38 % of the true grave mounds, with 89 % false positives. On a 937 km(2) area covering Ovre Eiker municipality, Viken County, the R-CNN correctly identified 90 % of the charcoal kilns, with 38 % false positives.
   In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Faster R-CNN is well suited for semi-automatic detection of cultural heritage objects such as charcoal kilns, grave mounds and pitfall traps in high resolution airborne lidar data. However, it is desirable to reduce the false positive rate in order to limit the amount of visual inspection needed when the method is applied to large areas for detailed archaeological mapping.

AB Compressive sensing (CS) is an effective technique for reconstructing image from a small amount of sampled data. It has been widely applied in medical imaging, remote sensing, image compression, etc. In this paper, we propose two versions of a novel deep learning architecture, dubbed as ADMM-CSNet, by combining the traditional model-based CS method and data-driven deep learning method for image reconstruction from sparsely sampled measurements. We first consider a generalized CS model for image reconstruction with undetermined regularizations in undetermined transform domains, and then two efficient solvers using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for optimizing the model are proposed. We further unroll and generalize the ADMM algorithm to be two deep architectures, in which all parameters of the CS model and the ADMM algorithm are discriminatively learned by end-to-end training. For both applications of fast CS complex-valued MR imaging and CS imaging of real-valued natural images, the proposed ADMM-CSNet achieved favorable reconstruction accuracy in fast computational speed compared with the traditional and the other deep learning methods.

ID BEHAVIOR; TRACKING
AB Quantifying behavior is crucial for many applications in neuroscience. Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies, humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with computer-based tracking, but markers are intrusive, and the number and location of the markers must be determined a priori. Here we present an efficient method for markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in multiple species across a broad collection of behaviors. Remarkably, even when only a small number of frames are labeled (similar to 200), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.

ID QUALITY ASSESSMENT
AB We propose a deep learning method for single image super-resolution (SR). Our method directly learns an end-to-end mapping between the low/high-resolution images. The mapping is represented as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes the low-resolution image as the input and outputs the high-resolution one. We further show that traditional sparse-coding-based SR methods can also be viewed as a deep convolutional network. But unlike traditional methods that handle each component separately, our method jointly optimizes all layers. Our deep CNN has a lightweight structure, yet demonstrates state-of-the-art restoration quality, and achieves fast speed for practical on-line usage. We explore different network structures and parameter settings to achieve trade-offs between performance and speed. Moreover, we extend our network to cope with three color channels simultaneously, and show better overall reconstruction quality.

AB Inferior temporal (IT) cortex in human and nonhuman primates serves visual object recognition. Computational object-vision models, although continually improving, do not yet reach human performance. It is unclear to what extent the internal representations of computational models can explain the IT representation. Here we investigate a wide range of computational model representations (37 in total), testing their categorization performance and their ability to account for the IT representational geometry. The models include well-known neuroscientific object-recognition models (e. g. HMAX, VisNet) along with several models from computer vision (e. g. SIFT, GIST, self-similarity features, and a deep convolutional neural network). We compared the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) of the model representations with the RDMs obtained from human IT (measured with fMRI) and monkey IT (measured with cell recording) for the same set of stimuli (not used in training the models). Better performing models were more similar to IT in that they showed greater clustering of representational patterns by category. In addition, better performing models also more strongly resembled IT in terms of their within-category representational dissimilarities. Representational geometries were significantly correlated between IT and many of the models. However, the categorical clustering observed in IT was largely unexplained by the unsupervised models. The deep convolutional network, which was trained by supervision with over a million categorylabeled images, reached the highest categorization performance and also best explained IT, although it did not fully explain the IT data. Combining the features of this model with appropriate weights and adding linear combinations that maximize the margin between animate and inanimate objects and between faces and other objects yielded a representation that fully explained our IT data. Overall, our results suggest that explaining IT requires computational features trained through supervised learning to emphasize the behaviorally important categorical divisions prominently reflected in IT.

ID RECOGNITION
AB This paper presents a new discriminative deep metric learning (DDML) method for face and kinship verification in wild conditions. While metric learning has achieved reasonably good performance in face and kinship verification, most existing metric learning methods aim to learn a single Mahalanobis distance metric to maximize the inter-class variations and minimize the intra-class variations, which cannot capture the nonlinear manifold where face images usually lie on. To address this, we propose a DDML method to train a deep neural network to learn a set of hierarchical nonlinear transformations to project face pairs into the same latent feature space, under which the distance of each positive pair is reduced and that of each negative pair is enlarged. To better use the commonality of multiple feature descriptors to make all the features more robust for face and kinship verification, we develop a discriminative deep multimetric learning method to jointly learn multiple neural networks, under which the correlation of different features of each sample is maximized, and the distance of each positive pair is reduced and that of each negative pair is enlarged. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed methods achieve the acceptable results in both face and kinship verification.

AB We determine the efficiency of a delivery system in which an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides service to customers while making return trips to a truck that is itself moving. In other words, a UAV picks up a package from the truck (which continues on its route), and after delivering the package, the UAV returns to the truck to pick up the next package. Although the hardware for such systems already exists, the extent to which such an approach can actually provide a significantly improved quality of service is not yet understood. By combining a theoretical analysis in the Euclidean plane with real-time numerical simulations on a road network, we demonstrate that the improvement in efficiency is proportional to the square root of the ratio of the speeds of the truck and the UAV.

AB Network traffic classification has become more important with the rapid growth of Internet and online applications. Numerous studies have been done on this topic which have led to many different approaches. Most of these approaches use predefined features extracted by an expert in order to classify network traffic. In contrast, in this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach which integrates both feature extraction and classification phases into one system. Our proposed scheme, called "Deep Packet," can handle both traffic characterization in which the network traffic is categorized into major classes (e.g., FTP and P2P) and application identification in which identifying end-user applications (e.g., BitTorrent and Skype) is desired. Contrary to most of the current methods, Deep Packet can identify encrypted traffic and also distinguishes between VPN and non-VPN network traffic. The Deep Packet framework employs two deep neural network structures, namely stacked autoencoder (SAE) and convolution neural network (CNN) in order to classify network traffic. Our experiments show that the best result is achieved when Deep Packet uses CNN as its classification model where it achieves recall of 0.98 in application identification task and 0.94 in traffic categorization task. To the best of our knowledge, Deep Packet outperforms all of the proposed classification methods on UNB ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset.

AB Purpose: To compare the diagnostic performance of radiomic analysis (RA) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to radiologists for classification of contrast agent-enhancing lesions as benign or malignant at multiparametric breast MRI.
   Materials and Methods: Between August 2011 and August 2015, 447 patients with 1294 enhancing lesions (787 malignant, 507 benign; median size, 15 mm + 20) were evaluated. Lesions were manually segmented by one breast radiologist. RA was performed by using L1 regularization and principal component analysis. CNN used a deep residual neural network with 34 layers. All algorithms were also retrained on half the number of lesions (n = 647). Machine interpretations were compared with prospective interpretations by three breast radiologists. Standard of reference was histologic analysis or follow-up. Areas under the receiver operating curve (AUCs) were used to compare diagnostic performance.
   Results: CNN trained on the full cohort was superior to training on the half-size cohort (AUC, 0.88 vs 0.83, respectively; P =.01), but there was no difference for RA and L1 regularization (AUC, 0.81 vs 0.80, respectively; P =.76) or RA and principal component analysis (AUC, 0.78 vs 0.78, respectively; P =.93). By using the full cohort, CNN performance (AUC, 0.88; 95% confidence interval: 0.86, 0.89) was better than RA and L1 regularization (AUC, 0.81; 95% confidence interval: 0.79, 0.83; P<.001) and RA and principal component analysis (AUC, 0.78; 95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.80; P<.001). However, CNN was inferior to breast radiologist interpretation (AUC, 0.98; 95% confidence interval: 0.96, 0.99; P < .001).
   Conclusion: A convolutional neural network was superior to radiomic analysis for classification of enhancing lesions as benign or malignant at multiparametric breast MRI. Both approaches were inferior to radiologists' performance; however, more training data will further improve performance of convolutional neural network, but not that of radiomics algorithms.

AB Various forms of machine learning (ML) methods have historically played a valuable role in environmental remote sensing research. With an increasing amount of "big data" from earth observation and rapid advances in ML, increasing opportunities for novel methods have emerged to aid in earth environmental monitoring. Over the last decade, a typical and state-of-the-art ML framework named deep learning (DL), which is developed from the traditional neural network (NN), has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in performance. Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has been observed. Therefore, this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to advance the environmental remote sensing process. First, the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing, including land cover mapping, environmental parameter retrieval, data fusion and downscaling, and information reconstruction and prediction, will be analyzed. A typical network structure will then be introduced. Afterward, the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere, vegetation, hydrology, air and land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, solar radiation, and ocean color are specifically reviewed. Finally, challenges and future perspectives will be comprehensively analyzed and discussed.

AB This paper presents the development, testing and validation of SWEEPER, a robot for harvesting sweet pepper fruit in greenhouses. The robotic system includes a six degrees of freedom industrial arm equipped with a specially designed end effector, RGB-D camera, high-end computer with graphics processing unit, programmable logic controllers, other electronic equipment, and a small container to store harvested fruit. All is mounted on a cart that autonomously drives on pipe rails and concrete floor in the end-user environment. The overall operation of the harvesting robot is described along with details of the algorithms for fruit detection and localization, grasp pose estimation, and motion control. The main contributions of this paper are the integrated system design and its validation and extensive field testing in a commercial greenhouse for different varieties and growing conditions. A total of 262 fruits were involved in a 4-week long testing period. The average cycle time to harvest a fruit was 24 s. Logistics took approximately 50% of this time (7.8 s for discharge of fruit and 4.7 s for platform movements). Laboratory experiments have proven that the cycle time can be reduced to 15 s by running the robot manipulator at a higher speed. The harvest success rates were 61% for the best fit crop conditions and 18% in current crop conditions. This reveals the importance of finding the best fit crop conditions and crop varieties for successful robotic harvesting. The SWEEPER robot is the first sweet pepper harvesting robot to demonstrate this kind of performance in a commercial greenhouse.

AB As a key technique for enabling artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML) is capable of solving complex problems without explicit programming. Motivated by its successful applications to many practical tasks like image recognition, both industry and the research community have advocated the applications of ML in wireless communication. This paper comprehensively surveys the recent advances of the applications of ML in wireless communication, which are classified as: resource management in the MAC layer, networking and mobility management in the network layer, and localization in the application layer. The applications in resource management further include power control, spectrum management, backhaul management, cache management, and beamformer design and computation resource management, while ML-based networking focuses on the applications in clustering, base station switching control, user association, and routing. Moreover, literatures in each aspect is organized according to the adopted ML techniques. In addition, several conditions for applying ML to wireless communication are identified to help readers decide whether to use ML and which kind of ML techniques to use. Traditional approaches are also summarized together with their performance comparison with ML-based approaches, based on which the motivations of surveyed literatures to adopt ML are clarified. Given the extensiveness of the research area, challenges and unresolved issues are presented to facilitate future studies. Specifically, ML-based network slicing, infrastructure update to support ML-based paradigms, open data sets and platforms for researchers, theoretical guidance for ML implementation, and so on are discussed.

AB In the last 10 years, development in robotics, computer vision, and sensor technology has provided new spectral remote sensing tools to capture unprecedented ultra-high spatial and high spectral resolution with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This development has led to a revolution in geospatial data collection in which not only few specialist data providers collect and deliver remotely sensed data, but a whole diverse community is potentially able to gather geospatial data that fit their needs. However, the diversification of sensing systems and user applications challenges the common application of good practice procedures that ensure the quality of the data. This challenge can only be met by establishing and communicating common procedures that have had demonstrated success in scientific experiments and operational demonstrations. In this review, we evaluate the state-of-the-art methods in UAV spectral remote sensing and discuss sensor technology, measurement procedures, geometric processing, and radiometric calibration based on the literature and more than a decade of experimentation. We follow the journey' of the reflected energy from the particle in the environment to its representation as a pixel in a 2D or 2.5D map, or 3D spectral point cloud. Additionally, we reflect on the current revolution in remote sensing, and identify trends, potential opportunities, and limitations.

AB We recently proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN) for remote sensing image pansharpening obtaining a significant performance gain over the state of the art. In this paper, we explore a number of architectural and training variations to this baseline, achieving further performance gains with a lightweight network that trains very fast. Leveraging on this latter property, we propose a target-adaptive usage modality that ensures a very good performance also in the presence of a mismatch with respect to the training set and even across different sensors. The proposed method, published online as an off-the-shelf software tool, allows users to perform fast and high-quality CNN-based pansharpening of their own target images on general-purpose hardware.

AB Computational methods that automatically extract knowledge from data are critical for enabling data-driven materials science. A reliable identification of lattice symmetry is a crucial first step for materials characterization and analytics. Current methods require a user-specified threshold, and are unable to detect average symmetries for defective structures. Here, we propose a machine learning-based approach to automatically classify structures by crystal symmetry. First, we represent crystals by calculating a diffraction image, then construct a deep learning neural network model for classification. Our approach is able to correctly classify a dataset comprising more than 100,000 simulated crystal structures, including heavily defective ones. The internal operations of the neural network are unraveled through attentive response maps, demonstrating that it uses the same landmarks a materials scientist would use, although never explicitly instructed to do so. Our study paves the way for crystal structure recognition of-possibly noisy and incomplete-three-dimensional structural data in big-data materials science.

AB OBJECTIVES This study investigated whether a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) could provide improved detection of regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMAs) and differentiate among groups of coronary infarction territories from conventional 2-dimensional echocardiographic images compared with that of cardiologists, sonographers, and resident readers.
   BACKGROUND An effective intervention for reduction of misreading of RWMAs is needed. The hypothesis was that a DCNN trained using echocardiographic images would provide improved detection of RWMAs in the clinical setting.
   METHODS A total of 300 patients with a history of myocardial infarction were enrolled. From this cohort, 3 groups of 100 patients each had infarctions of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, the left circumflex (LCX) branch, and the right coronary artery (RCA). A total of 100 age-matched control patients with normal wall motion were selected from a database. Each case contained cardiac ultrasonographs from short-axis views at end-diastolic, mid-systolic, and end-systolic phases. After the DCNN underwent 100 steps of training, diagnostic accuracies were calculated from the test set. Independently, 10 versions of the same model were trained, and ensemble predictions were performed using those versions.
   RESULTS For detection of the presence of WMAs, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) produced by the deep learning algorithm was similar to that produced by the cardiologists and sonographer readers (0.99 vs. 0.98, respectively; p = 0.15) and significantly higher than the AUC result of the resident readers (0.99 vs. 0.90, respectively; p = 0.002). For detection of territories of WMAs, the AUC by the deep learning algorithm was similar to the AUC by the cardiologist and sonographer readers (0.97 vs. 0.95, respectively; p = 0.61) and significantly higher than the AUC by resident readers (0.97 vs. 0.83, respectively; p = 0.003). From a validation group at an independent site (n = 40), the AUC by the deep learning algorithm was 0.90.
   CONCLUSIONS The present results support the possibility of using DCNN for automated diagnosis of RWMAs in the field of echocardiography. (C) 2020 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

AB Cardiovascular imaging is going to change substantially in the next decade, fueled by the deep learning revolution. For medical professionals, it is important to keep track of these developments to ensure that deep learning can have meaningful impact on clinical practice. This review aims to be a stepping stone in this process. The general concepts underlying most successful deep learning algorithms are explained, and an overview of the state-of-the-art deep learning in cardiovascular imaging is provided. This review discusses >80 papers, covering modalities ranging from cardiac magnetic resonance, computed tomography, and single-photon emission computed tomography, to intravascular optical coherence tomography and echocardiography. Many different machines learning algorithms were used throughout these papers, with the most common being convolutional neural networks. Recent algorithms such as generative adversarial models were also used. The potential implications of deep learning algorithms on clinical practice, now and in the near future, are discussed.

AB Most of the advancements are now carried out by interconnecting physical devices with computers; this is what known as Internet of Things (IoT). The major problems facing by blind people fall in the category of navigating through indoor and outdoor environments consisting of various obstacles and recognition of person in front of them. Identification of objects or person only with perceptive and audio information is difficult. An intelligent, portable, less expensive, self-contained navigation and face recognition system is highly demanded for blind people. This helps blind people to navigate with the help of a Smartphone, global positioning system (GPS) and a system equipped with ultrasonic sensors. Face recognition can be done using neural learning techniques with feature extraction and training modules. The images of friends, relatives are stored in the database of user Smartphone. Whenever a person comes in front of the blind user, the application with the help of neural network gives the voice aid to the user. Thus this system can replace the regular imprecise use of guide dogs as well as white sticks to help the navigation and face recognition process for people with impaired vision. In this paper, we have proposed a novel image recognition and navigation system which provides precise and quick messages in the form of audio to visually challenged people so that they can navigate easily. The performance of the proposed method is comparatively analyzed with the help of ROC analysis.

AB Time Series Classification (TSC) is an important and challenging problem in data mining. With the increase of time series data availability, hundreds of TSC algorithms have been proposed. Among these methods, only a few have considered Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to perform this task. This is surprising as deep learning has seen very successful applications in the last years. DNNs have indeed revolutionized the field of computer vision especially with the advent of novel deeper architectures such as Residual and Convolutional Neural Networks. Apart from images, sequential data such as text and audio can also be processed with DNNs to reach state-of-the-art performance for document classification and speech recognition. In this article, we study the current state-of-the-art performance of deep learning algorithms for TSC by presenting an empirical study of the most recent DNN architectures for TSC. We give an overview of the most successful deep learning applications in various time series domains under a unified taxonomy of DNNs for TSC. We also provide an open source deep learning framework to the TSC community where we implemented each of the compared approaches and evaluated them on a univariate TSC benchmark (the UCR/UEA archive) and 12 multivariate time series datasets. By training 8730 deep learning models on 97 time series datasets, we propose the most exhaustive study of DNNs for TSC to date.

AB The advent of inexpensive consumer virtual reality equipment enables many more researchers to study perception with naturally moving observers. One such system, the HTC Vive, offers a large field-of-view, high-resolution head mounted display together with a room-scale tracking system for less than a thousand U.S. dollars. If the position and orientation tracking of this system is of sufficient accuracy and precision, it could be suitable for much research that is currently done with far more expensive systems. Here we present a quantitative test of the HTC Vive's position and orientation tracking as well as its end-to-end system latency. We report that while the precision of the Vive's tracking measurements is high and its system latency (22ms) is low, its position and orientation measurements are provided in a coordinate system that is tilted with respect to the physical ground plane. Because large changes in offset were found whenever tracking was briefly lost, it cannot be corrected for with a one-time calibration procedure. We conclude that the varying offset between the virtual and the physical tracking space makes the HTC Vive at present unsuitable for scientific experiments that require accurate visual stimulation of self-motion through a virtual world. It may however be suited for other experiments that do not have this requirement.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a multipurpose image analysis software based on deep learning with artificial neural networks for the detection of breast cancer in an independent, dual-center mammography data set.
   Materials and Methods: In this retrospective, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study, all patients undergoing mammography in 2012 at our institution were reviewed (n = 3228). All of their prior and follow-up mammographies from a time span of 7 years (2008-2015) were considered as a reference for clinical diagnosis. After applying exclusion criteria (missing reference standard, prior procedures or therapies), patients with the first diagnosis of a malignoma or borderline lesion were selected (n = 143). Histology or clinical long-term follow-up served as reference standard. In a first step, a breast density-and age-matched control cohort was selected (n = 143) from the remaining patients with more than 2 years follow-up (n = 1003). The neural network was trained with this data set. From the publicly available Breast Cancer Digital Repository data set, patients with cancer and a matched control cohort were selected (n = 35 x 2). The performance of the trained neural network was also tested with this external data set. Three radiologists (3, 5, and 10 years of experience) evaluated the test data set. In a second step, the neural network was trained with all cases from January to September and tested with cases from October to December 2012 (screening-like cohort). The radiologists also evaluated this second test data set. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between readers and the neural network were compared. A Bonferroni-corrected P value of less than 0.016 was considered statistically significant.
   Results: Mean age of patients with lesion was 59.6 years (range, 35-88 years) and in controls, 59.1 years (35-83 years). Breast density distribution (A/B/C/D) was 21/59/42/21 and 22/60/41/20, respectively. Histologic diagnoses were invasive ductal carcinoma in 90, ductal in situ carcinoma in 13, invasive lobular carcinoma in 13, mucinous carcinoma in 3, and borderline lesion in 12 patients. In the first step, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the trained neural network was 0.81 and comparable on the test cases 0.79 (P - 0.63). One of the radiologists showed almost equal performance (0.83, P - 0.17), whereas 2 were significantly better (0.91 and 0.94, P < 0.016). In the second step, performance of the neural network (0.82) was not significantly different from the human performance (0.77-0.87, P > 0.016); however, radiologists were consistently less sensitive and more specific than the neural network.
   Conclusions: Current state-of-the-art artificial neural networks for general image analysis are able to detect cancer in mammographies with similar accuracy to radiologists, even in a screening-like cohort with low breast cancer prevalence.

AB Falls are a major health concern in older adults. Falls lead to mortality, immobility and high costs to social and health care services. Early detection and classification of falls is imperative for timely and appropriate medical aid response. Traditional machine learning models have been explored for fall classification. While newly developed deep learning techniques have the ability to potentially extract high-level features from raw sensor data providing high accuracy and robustness to variations in sensor position, orientation and diversity of work environments that may skew traditional classification models. However, frequently used deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are computationally intensive. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first instance of a Hybrid Multichannel Random Neural Network (HMCRNN) architecture for fall detection and classification. The proposed architecture provides the highest accuracy of 92.23% with dropout regularization, compared to other deep learning implementations. The performance of the proposed technique is approximately comparable to a CNN yet requires only half the computation cost of the CNN-based implementation. Furthermore, the proposed HMCRNN architecture provides 34.12% improvement in accuracy on average than a Multilayer Perceptron.

AB In order to take advantage of the potential offered by the medium of virtual reality (VR), it will be essential to develop an understanding of how to maximize the desirable experience of "presence" in a virtual space ("being there"), and how to minimize the undesirable feeling of "cybersickness" (a constellation of discomfort symptoms experienced in VR). Although there have been frequent reports of a possible link between the observer's sense of presence and the experience of bodily discomfort in VR, the amount of literature that discusses the nature of the relationship is limited. Recent research has underlined the possibility that these variables have shared causes, and that both factors may be manipulated with a single approach. This review paper summarizes the concepts of presence and cybersickness and highlights the strengths and gaps in our understanding about their relationship. We review studies that have measured the association between presence and cybersickness, and conclude that the balance of evidence favors a negative relationship between the two factors which is driven principally by sensory integration processes. We also discuss how system immersiveness might play a role in modulating both presence and cybersickness. However, we identify a serious absence of high-powered studies that aim to reveal the nature of this relationship. Based on this evidence we propose recommendations for future studies investigating presence, cybersickness, and other related factors.

AB In virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET), patients are exposed to virtual environments that resemble feared real-life situations. The aim of the current study was to assess the extent to which VRET gains can be observed in real-life situations. We conducted a meta-analysis of clinical trials applying VRET to specific phobias and measuring treatment outcome by means of behavioral laboratory tests or recordings of behavioral activities in real-life. Data sources were searches of databases (Medline, PsycInfo, and Cochrane). We included in total 14 clinical trials on specific phobias. Results revealed that patients undergoing VRET did significantly better on behavioral assessments following treatment than before treatment, with an aggregated uncontrolled effect size of g = 1.23. Furthermore, patients undergoing VRET performed better on behavioral assessments at post-treatment than patients on wait-list (g = 1.41). Additionally, results of behavioral assessment at post-treatment and at follow-up revealed no significant differences between VRET and exposure in vivo (g = -0.09 and 0.53, respectively). Finally, behavioral measurement effect sizes were similar to those calculated from self-report measures. The findings demonstrate that VRET can produce significant behavior change in real-life situations and support its application in treating specific phobias. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we proposed a novel end-to-end transductive deep transfer learning network (TDTLN) to deal with the challenging cross-domain expression recognition problem, in which both the source and target databases are utilized to jointly learn optimal nonlinear discriminative features so as to improve the label prediction performance of the target data samples. As part of the network parameters, the labels of the target samples are also optimized when optimizing the parameters of TDTLN, such that the cross-entropy loss of source domain data and the regression loss of target domain data can be simultaneously calculated. Finally, to evaluate the recognition performance of the proposed TDTLN method, we conduct extensive cross-database experiments on four commonly used multi-view facial expression databases, namely the BU-3DEF, Multi-PIE, SFEW, and RAF database. The experimental results show that the proposed TDTLN method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

DE Heterogeneous face recognition; VIS-NIR face matching; feature

ID SPECTRAL REGRESSION; COUPLED DICTIONARY
AB Heterogeneous face recognition (HFR) aims at matching facial images acquired from different sensing modalities with mission-critical applications in forensics, security and commercial sectors. However, HFR presents more challenging issues than traditional face recognition because of the large intra-class variation among heterogeneous face images and the limited availability of training samples of cross-modality face image pairs. This paper proposes the novel Wasserstein convolutional neural network (WCNN) approach for learning invariant features between near-infrared (NIR) and visual (VIS) face images (i.e., NIR-VIS face recognition). The low-level layers of the WCNN are trained with widely available face images in the VIS spectrum, and the high-level layer is divided into three parts: the NIR layer, the VIS layer and the NIR-VIS shared layer. The first two layers aim at learning modality-specific features, and the NIR-VIS shared layer is designed to learn a modality-invariant feature subspace. The Wasserstein distance is introduced into the NIR-VIS shared layer to measure the dissimilarity between heterogeneous feature distributions. W-CNN leaming is performed to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the NIR distribution and the VIS distribution for invariant deep feature representations of heterogeneous face images. To avoid the over-fitting problem on small-scale heterogeneous face data, a correlation prior is introduced on the fully-connected WCNN layers to reduce the size of the parameter space. This prior is implemented by a low-rank constraint in an end-to-end network. The joint formulation leads to an alternating minimization for deep feature representation at the training stage and an efficient computation for heterogeneous data at the testing stage. Extensive experiments using three challenging NIR-VIS face recognition databases demonstrate the superiority of the WCNN method over state-of-the-art methods.

Recently, Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been implemented in the SDN-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to protect computer networks and to overcome network security issues. A stream of advanced machine learning approaches - the deep learning technology (DL) commences to emerge in the SDN context. In this survey, we reviewed various recent works on machine learning (ML) methods that leverage SDN to implement NIDS. More specifically, we evaluated the techniques of deep learning in developing SDN-based NIDS. In the meantime, in this survey, we covered tools that can be used to develop NIDS models in SDN environment. This survey is concluded with a discussion of ongoing challenges in implementing NIDS using ML/DL and future works.

AB Purpose: To compare the performance of a deep-learning bone age assessment model based on hand radiographs with that of expert radiologists and that of existing automated models.
   Materials and Methods: The institutional review board approved the study. A total of 14 036 clinical hand radiographs and corresponding reports were obtained from two children's hospitals to train and validate the model. For the first test set, composed of 200 examinations, the mean of bone age estimates from the clinical report and three additional human reviewers was used as the reference standard. Overall model performance was assessed by comparing the root mean square (RMS) and mean absolute difference (MAD) between the model estimates and the reference standard bone ages. Ninety-five percent limits of agreement were calculated in a pairwise fashion for all reviewers and the model. The RMS of a second test set composed of 913 examinations from the publicly available Digital Hand Atlas was compared with published reports of an existing automated model.
   Results: The mean difference between bone age estimates of the model and of the reviewers was 0 years, with a mean RMS and MAD of 0.63 and 0.50 years, respectively. The estimates of the model, the clinical report, and the three reviewers were within the 95% limits of agreement. RMS for the Digital Hand Atlas data set was 0.73 years, compared with 0.61 years of a previously reported model.
   Conclusion: A deep-learning convolutional neural network model can estimate skeletal maturity with accuracy similar to that of an expert radiologist and to that of existing automated models.

AB This paper demonstrated the use of the supervised Machine Learning (ML) for text classification to predict students' final course grades in a hybrid Advanced Statistics course and exhibited the potential of using ML classified messages to identify students at risk of course failure. We built three classification models with training data of 76,936 posts from two large online forums and applied the models to classify messages into statistics-related and non-statistics-related posts in a private Facebook group. Three ML algorithms were compared in terms of classification effectiveness and congruency with human coding. Students with more messages endorsed by two or more ML algorithms as statistics-related had higher final course grades. Students who failed the course also had significantly fewer messages endorsed by all three ML algorithms than those who passed. Results suggest that ML can be used for identifying students in need of support within the personal learning environment and for quality control of the large-scale educational data.

AB Virtual reality (VR) tourism provides consumers with the opportunity to experience a destination in VR and can play a significant role in encouraging visitation and engaging in particular travel activities and behaviors. Hedonic motivation adoption frameworks with flow state and subjective well-being have been shown to have significant roles in continued use of information technology. However, research on a theoretically integrated hedonic motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) specifically with enjoyment, flow state, subjective wellbeing, and continued use has not previously been conducted with respect to VR tourism. To address this gap, this study develops and investigates a conceptually comprehensive model on the effect of consumers' hedonic behaviors on continued use, with the moderating role of visitor or non-visitor at the destination portrayed in VR tourism. Results identified the highly significant effect of consumers' perceived enjoyment on flow state and of flow state on subjective well-being. Continued use was greatly influenced by flow state and subjective wellbeing. Importantly for destinations association between usefulness and flow state had a significant moderating effect depending on whether a visitor or non-visitor. The findings offer new knowledge to researchers and industry in the VR tourism fields.

AB This comprehensive review summarizes state of the art, challenges, and prospects of the neuro-inspired computing with emerging nonvolatile memory devices. First, we discuss the demand for developing neuro-inspired architecture beyond today's von-Neumann architecture. Second, we summarize the various approaches to designing the neuromorphic hardware (digital versus analog, spiking versus nonspiking, online training versus offline training) and discuss why emerging nonvolatile memory is attractive for implementing the synapses in the neural network. Then, we discuss the desired device characteristics of the synaptic devices (e.g., multilevel states, weight update nonlinearity/asymmetry, variation/noise), and survey a few representative material systems and device prototypes reported in the literature that show the analog conductance tuning. These candidates include phase change memory, resistive memory, ferroelectric memory, floating-gate transistors, etc.Next, we introduce the crossbar array architecture to accelerate the weighted sum and weight update operations that are commonly used in the neuro-inspired machine learning algorithms, and review the recent progresses of array-level experimental demonstrations for pattern recognition tasks. In addition, we discuss the peripheral neuron circuit design issues and present a device-circuit-algorithm codesign methodology to evaluate the impact of nonideal device effects on the system-level performance (e.g., learning accuracy). Finally, we give an outlook on the customization of the learning algorithms for efficient hardware implementation.

AB Worldwide interest in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, including imaging, is high and growing rapidly, fueled by availability of large datasets ("big data"), substantial advances in computing power, and new deep-learning algorithms. Apart from developing new AI methods per se, there are many opportunities and challenges for the imaging community, including the development of a common nomenclature, better ways to share image data, and standards for validating AI program use across different imaging platforms and Patient populations. AI surveillance programs may help radiologists prioritize work lists by identifying suspicious or positive cases for early review. AI programs can be used to extract "radiomic" information from images not discernible by visual inspection, potentially increasing the diagnostic and prognostic value derived from image datasets. Predictions have been made that suggest AI will put radiologists out of business. This issue has been overstated, and it is much more likely that radiologists will beneficially incorporate AI methods into their practices. Current limitations in availability of technical expertise and even computing power will be resolved over time and can also be addressed by remote access solutions. Success for AI in imaging will be measured by value created: increased diagnostic certainty, faster turnaround, better outcomes for patients, and better quality of work life for radiologists. AI offers a new and promising set of methods for analyzing image data. Radiologists will explore these new pathways and are likely to play a leading role in medical applications of AI.

AB Credit scoring (CS) is an effective and crucial approach used for risk management in banks and other financial institutions. It provides appropriate guidance on granting loans and reduces risks in the financial area. Hence, companies and banks are trying to use novel automated solutions to deal with CS challenge to protect their own finances and customers. Nowadays, different machine learning (ML) and data mining (DM) algorithms have been used to improve various aspects of CS prediction. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology, named Deep Genetic Hierarchical Network of Learners (DGHNL). The proposed methodology comprises different types of learners, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN), and fuzzy systems. The Statlog German (1000 instances) credit approval dataset available in the UCI machine learning repository is used to test the effectiveness of our model in the CS domain. Our DGHNL model encompasses five kinds of learners, two kinds of data normalization procedures, two extraction of features methods, three kinds of kernel functions, and three kinds of parameter optimizations. Furthermore, the model applies deep learning, ensemble learning, supervised training, layered learning, genetic selection of features (attributes), genetic optimization of learners parameters, and novel genetic layered training (selection of learners) approaches used along with the cross-validation (CV) train-ingtesting method (stratified 10-fold). The novelty of our approach relies on a proper flow and fusion of information (DGHNL structure and its optimization). We show that the proposed DGHNL model with a 29-layer structure is capable to achieve the prediction accuracy of 94.60% (54 errors per 1000 classifications) for the Statlog German credit approval data. It is the best prediction performance for this well-known credit scoring dataset, compared to the existing work in the field. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID EIGENSTRUCTURE ASSIGNMENT; ONLINE SOLUTION
AB Bartels-Stewart algorithm is an effective and widely used method with an O(n (3)) time complexity for solving a static Sylvester equation. When applied to time-varying Sylvester equation, the computation burden increases intensively with the decrease of sampling period and cannot satisfy continuous realtime calculation requirements. Gradient-based recurrent neural network are able to solve the time-varying Sylvester equation in real time but there always exists an estimation error. In contrast, the recently proposed Zhang neural network has been proven to converge to the solution of the Sylvester equation ideally when time goes to infinity. However, this neural network with the suggested activation functions never converges to the desired value in finite time, which may limit its applications in realtime processing. To tackle this problem, a sign-bi-power activation function is proposed in this paper to accelerate Zhang neural network to finite-time convergence. The global convergence and finite-time convergence property are proven in theory. The upper bound of the convergence time is derived analytically. Simulations are performed to evaluate the performance of the neural network with the proposed activation function. In addition, the proposed strategy is applied to online calculating the pseudo-inverse of a matrix and nonlinear control of an inverted pendulum system. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of proposed activation function.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied to visual tasks since the late 1980s. However, despite a few scattered applications, they were dormant until the mid-2000s when developments in computing power and the advent of large amounts of labeled data, supplemented by improved algorithms, contributed to their advancement and brought them to the forefront of a neural network renaissance that has seen rapid progression since 2012. In this review, which focuses on the application of CNNs to image classification tasks, we cover their development, from their predecessors up to recent state-of-the-art deep learning systems. Along the way, we analyze (1) their early successes, (2) their role in the deep learning renaissance, (3) selected symbolic works that have contributed to their recent popularity, and (4) several improvement attempts by reviewing contributions and challenges of over 300 publications. We also introduce some of their current trends and remaining challenges.

AB Buildings account for about 40% of the global energy consumption. Renewable energy resources are one possibility to mitigate the dependence of residential buildings on the electrical grid. However, their integration into the existing grid infrastructure must be done carefully to avoid instability, and guarantee availability and security of supply. Demand response, or demand-side management, improves grid stability by increasing demand flexibility, and shifts peak demand towards periods of peak renewable energy generation by providing consumers with economic incentives. This paper reviews the use of reinforcement learning, a machine learning algorithm, for demand response applications in the smart grid. Reinforcement learning has been utilized to control diverse energy systems such as electric vehicles, heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, smart appliances, or batteries. The future of demand response greatly depends on its ability to prevent consumer discomfort and integrate human feedback into the control loop. Reinforcement learning is a potentially model-free algorithm that can adapt to its environment, as well as to human preferences by directly integrating user feedback into its control logic. Our review shows that, although many papers consider human comfort and satisfaction, most of them focus on single-agent systems with demand-independent electricity prices and a stationary environment. However, when electricity prices are modelled as demand-dependent variables, there is a risk of shifting the peak demand rather than shaving it. We identify a need to further explore reinforcement learning to coordinate multi-agent systems that can participate in demand response programs under demand-dependent electricity prices. Finally, we discuss directions for future research, e.g., quantifying how RL could adapt to changing urban conditions such as building refurbishment and urban or population growth.

AB Rain streaks, particularly in heavy rain, not only degrade visibility but also make many computer vision algorithms fail to function properly. In this paper, we address this visibility problem by focusing on single-image rain removal, even in the presence of dense rain streaks and rain-streak accumulation, which is visually similar to mist or fog. To achieve this, we introduce a new rain model and a deep learning architecture. Our rain model incorporates a binary rain map indicating rain-streak regions, and accommodates various shapes, directions, and sizes of overlapping rain streaks, as well as rain accumulation, to model heavy rain. Based on this model, we construct a multi-task deep network, which jointly learns three targets: the binary rain-streak map, rain streak layers, and clean background, which is our ultimate output. To generate features that can be invariant to rain steaks, we introduce a contextual dilated network, which is able to exploit regional contextual information. To handle various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, our strategy is to utilize a recurrent process that progressively removes rain streaks. Our binary map provides a constraint and thus additional information to train our network. Extensive evaluation on real images, particularly in heavy rain, shows the effectiveness of our model and architecture.

AB Pneumonia is among the top diseases which cause most of the deaths all over the world. Virus, bacteria and fungi can all cause pneumonia. However, it is difficult to judge the pneumonia just by looking at chest X-rays. The aim of this study is to simplify the pneumonia detection process for experts as well as for novices. We suggest a novel deep learning framework for the detection of pneumonia using the concept of transfer learning. In this approach, features from images are extracted using different neural network models pretrained on ImageNet, which then are fed into a classifier for prediction. We prepared five different models and analyzed their performance. Thereafter, we proposed an ensemble model that combines outputs from all pretrained models, which outperformed individual models, reaching the state-of-the-art performance in pneumonia recognition. Our ensemble model reached an accuracy of 96.4% with a recall of 99.62% on unseen data from the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center dataset.

ID DEEP; RECOGNITION; GENERATION; EFFICIENT; TRACKING; FUSION
AB Object detection is an important topic for visual data processing in the visual computing area. Although a number of approaches have been studied, it still remains a challenge. There is a suitable way to promote image classifiers by blending training with blended images and corresponding blended labels. However, our experiments show that directly moving existing blending methods from classification to object detection will cause the training process become harder and eventually will lead to a bad performance. Inspired by our discovery, this paper presents a multi-phase blending method with incremental blending intensity to improve the accuracy of object detectors and achieve remarkable improvements. Firstly, to adapt blending method to detection task, we propose a smoothly scheduled and incremental blending intensity to control the degree of multi-phase blending. Based on the above dynamic coefficient, we propose an incremental blending method, in which the blending intensity is smoothly increased from zero to full. Therefore, more complex and various data can be created to achieve the goal of regularizing the network. Secondly, we also design an incremental hybrid loss function to replace the original loss function. The blending intensity in our loss function increases smoothly, which is controlled by our scheduled coefficient. Thirdly, we further discard more negative examples in our multi-phase training process than other typical training methods and processes. By doing so, we can regularize the neural network to enhance generalization capability with data diversity and eventually to improve the accuracy in object detection. Another advantage is that there is no negative effect on evaluation because our method is just applied during the training process. Typical experiments show the proposed method improves the generalization of the detection networks. On PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art RFBNet of one-stage detectors for real-time processing.

AB Computational modeling of the primate visual system yields insights of potential relevance to some of the challenges that computer vision is facing, such as object recognition and categorization, motion detection and activity recognition, or vision-based navigation and manipulation. This paper reviews some functional principles and structures that are generally thought to underlie the primate visual cortex, and attempts to extract biological principles that could further advance computer vision research. Organized for a computer vision audience, we present functional principles of the processing hierarchies present in the primate visual system considering recent discoveries in neurophysiology. The hierarchical processing in the primate visual system is characterized by a sequence of different levels of processing (on the order of 10) that constitute a deep hierarchy in contrast to the flat vision architectures predominantly used in today's mainstream computer vision. We hope that the functional description of the deep hierarchies realized in the primate visual system provides valuable insights for the design of computer vision algorithms, fostering increasingly productive interaction between biological and computer vision research.

AB Learning from data has led to paradigm shifts in a multitude of disciplines, including web, text and image search, speech recognition, as well as bioinformatics. Can machine learning enable similar breakthroughs in understanding quantum many-body systems? Here we develop an efficient deep learning approach that enables spatially and chemically resolved insights into quantum-mechanical observables of molecular systems. We unify concepts from many-body Hamiltonians with purpose-designed deep tensor neural networks, which leads to size-extensive and uniformly accurate (1 kcal mol(-1)) predictions in compositional and configurational chemical space for molecules of intermediate size. As an example of chemical relevance, the model reveals a classification of aromatic rings with respect to their stability. Further applications of our model for predicting atomic energies and local chemical potentials in molecules, reliable isomer energies, and molecules with peculiar electronic structure demonstrate the potential of machine learning for revealing insights into complex quantum-chemical systems.

AB The main objective of the current study was to introduce a Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) model in landslide susceptibility assessments and compare its predictive performance with state-of-the-art machine learning models. The efficiency of the DLNN model was estimated for the Kon Tum Province, Viet Nam, an area characterized by the presence of landslide phenomena. Nine landslide related variables, elevation, slope angle, aspect, land use, normalized difference vegetation index, soil type, distance to faults, distance to geology boundaries, lithology cover, and 1,657 landslide locations, were used so as to produce the training and validation datasets during the landslide susceptibility assessment. The Frequency Ratio method was used so as to estimate the existing relation between the landslide-related variables and the presence of landslides, assigning to each variable class a weight value. Based on the results concerning the predictive ability of the landslide related variables which was evaluated using the Information ration method, all variables were further processed since they appear as highly predictive. The learning ability of the DLNN model has been evaluated and compared with a Multi Layer Preceptron Neural Network, a Support Vector Machine, a C4.5-Decision Tree model and a Random Forest model using the training dataset, whereas the predictive performance of each model has been evaluated and compared using the validation datascts. In order to evaluate their learning and predictive capacity of each model the classification accuracy, the sensitivity, the specificity and the area under the success and predictive rate curves (AUC) were calculated. Results showed that the proposed DLNN model had a higher performance than the four benchmark models. Although DLNN has been used seldom in landslide susceptibility assessments, the study highlights that the usage of deep learning approach could be considered as a satisfactory alternative approach for landslide susceptibility mapping.

To celebrate its anniversary, we look at artificial intelligence and the need to create the rules necessary for peaceful coexistence between humanity and AI. Hence, we now are urging: "Rulers of the world, unite!" In this article, we outline six debates surrounding AI in areas like artificial superintelligence, geographical progress, and robotics; in doing so, we shed light on what is fact and what is utopia. Then, using the PESTEL framework, we talk about the six dilemmas of AI and its potential threat and use. Finally, we provide six directions on the future of AI regarding its requirements and expectations, looking at enforcement, employment, ethics, education, entente, and evolution. Understanding AI's potential future will enable governments, corporations, and societies at large (i.e., the rulers of this world) to prepare for its challenges and opportunities.

AB Artificial neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing, sequence learning and reinforcement learning, but are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures and to store data over long timescales, owing to the lack of an external memory. Here we introduce a machine learning model called a differentiable neural computer (DNC), which consists of a neural network that can read from and write to an external memory matrix, analogous to the random-access memory in a conventional computer. Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data. When trained with supervised learning, we demonstrate that a DNC can successfully answer synthetic questions designed to emulate reasoning and inference problems in natural language. We show that it can learn tasks such as finding the shortest path between specified points and inferring the missing links in randomly generated graphs, and then generalize these tasks to specific graphs such as transport networks and family trees. When trained with reinforcement learning, a DNC can complete a moving blocks puzzle in which changing goals are specified by sequences of symbols. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DNCs have the capacity to solve complex, structured tasks that are inaccessible to neural networks without external read-write memory.

AB We present an algorithm for simultaneous face detection, landmarks localization, pose estimation and gender recognition using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The proposed method called, HyperFace, fuses the intermediate layers of a deep CNN using a separate CNN followed by a multi-task learning algorithm that operates on the fused features. It exploits the synergy among the tasks which boosts up their individual performances. Additionally, we propose two variants of HyperFace: (1) HyperFace-ResNet that builds on the ResNet-101 model and achieves significant improvement in performance, and (2) Fast-HyperFace that uses a high recall fast face detector for generating region proposals to improve the speed of the algorithm. Extensive experiments show that the proposed models are able to capture both global and local information in faces and performs significantly better than many competitive algorithms for each of these four tasks.

AB Online travel forums and social networks have become the most popular platform for sharing travel information, with enormous numbers of reviews posted daily. Automatically generated hotel summaries could aid travelers in selecting hotels. This study proposes a novel multi-text summarization technique for identifying the top-k most informative sentences of hotel reviews. Previous studies on review summarization have primarily examined content analysis, which disregards critical factors like author credibility and conflicting opinions. We considered such factors and developed a new sentence importance metric. Both the content and sentiment similarities were used to determine the similarity of two sentences. To identify the top-k sentences, the k-medoids clustering algorithm was used to partition sentences into k groups. The medoids from these groups were then selected as the final summarization results. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we collected two sets of reviews for the two hotels posted on TripAdvisor.com. A total of 20 subjects were invited to review the text summarization results from the proposed approach and two conventional approaches for the two hotels. The results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the other two, and most of the subjects believed that the proposed approach can provide more comprehensive hotel information.

ID ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; INFORMATION-SYSTEM; WATER-QUALITY
AB Rainfall-runoff modeling is a complex nonlinear time series problem. While there is still room for improvement, researchers have been developing physical and machine learning models for decades to predict runoff using rainfall data sets. With the advancement of computational hardware resources and algorithms, deep learning methods such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) model and sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling have shown a good deal of promise in dealing with time series problems by considering long-term dependencies and multiple outputs. This study presents an application of a prediction model based on LSTM and the seq2seq structure to estimate hourly rainfall-runoff. Focusing on two Midwestern watersheds, namely, Clear Creek and Upper Wapsipinicon River in Iowa, these models were used to predict hourly runoff for a 24-hr period using rainfall observation, rainfall forecast, runoff observation, and empirical monthly evapotranspiration data from all stations in these two watersheds. The models were evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient, the correlation coefficient, statistical bias, and the normalized root-mean-square error. The results show that the LSTM-seq2seq model outperforms linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, support vector regression, Gaussian processes regression, and LSTM in all stations from these two watersheds. The LSTM-seq2seq model shows sufficient predictive power and could be used to improve forecast accuracy in short-term flood forecast applications. In addition, the seq2seq method was demonstrated to be an effective method for time series predictions in hydrology.

AB Data driven building energy consumption forecasting models play a significant role in enhancing the energy efficiency of the buildings through building energy management, energy operations, and control strategies. The multi-source and heterogeneous energy consumption data necessitates the integration of evolutionary algorithms and data-driven models for better forecast accuracy and robustness. We present eDemand, an energy consumption forecasting model which employs long short term memory networks and improved sine cosine optimization algorithm for accurate and robust building energy consumption forecasting. A novel Haar wavelet based mutation operator was introduced to enhance the divergence nature of sine cosine optimization algorithm towards the global optimal solution. Further, the hyperparameters (learning rate, weight decay, momentum, and number of hidden layers) of the LSTM were optimized using the improved sine cosine optimization algorithm. A case study on the real-time energy consumption data obtained from Kanwal Rekhi building, an academic building at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay for short, mid, and long-term forecasting. Experiments reveal that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art energy consumption forecast models in terms of mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, mean square error, root mean square error, and Theil statistics. It is shown that stable and accurate forecast results are produced by ISCOA-LSTM and hence it can be used as an efficient tool for solving energy consumption forecast problems.

AB Inspired by recent advances in deep learning, we propose a framework for reconstructing dynamic sequences of 2-D cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images from undersampled data using a deep cascade of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accelerate the data acquisition process. In particular, we address the case where data are acquired using aggressive Cartesian undersampling. First, we show that when each 2-D image frame is reconstructed independently, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art 2-D compressed sensing approaches, such as dictionary learning-based MR image reconstruction, in terms of reconstruction error and reconstruction speed. Second, when reconstructing the frames of the sequences jointly, we demonstrate that CNNs can learn spatio-temporal correlations efficiently by combining convolution and data sharing approaches. We show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is capable of preserving anatomical structure more faithfully up to 11-fold undersampling. Moreover, reconstruction is very fast: each complete dynamic sequence can be reconstructed in less than 10 s and, for the 2-D case, each image frame can be reconstructed in 23 ms, enabling real-time applications.

AB Emerging technologies and applications including Internet of Things, social networking, and crowd-sourcing generate large amounts of data at the network edge. Machine learning models are often built from the collected data, to enable the detection, classification, and prediction of future events. Due to bandwidth, storage, and privacy concerns, it is often impractical to send all the data to a centralized location. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning model parameters from data distributed across multiple edge nodes, without sending raw data to a centralized place. Our focus is on a generic class of machine learning models that are trained using gradient-descent-based approaches. We analyze the convergence bound of distributed gradient descent from a theoretical point of view, based on which we propose a control algorithm that determines the best tradeoff between local update and global parameter aggregation to minimize the loss function under a given resource budget. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated via extensive experiments with real datasets, both on a networked prototype system and in a larger-scale simulated environment. The experimentation results show that our proposed approach performs near to the optimum with various machine learning models and different data distributions.

AB The rise of machine learning increases the current computing capabilities and paves the way to novel disruptive applications. In the current era of big data, the application of image retrieval technology for large-scale data is a popular research area. To ensure the robustness and security of digital image watermarking, we propose a novel algorithm using synergetic neural networks. The algorithm first processes a meaningful gray watermark image, then embeds it as a watermark signal into the block Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) component. The companion algorithm for detection and extraction of the watermark uses a cooperative neural network, where the suspected watermark signal is used as the input while the output consists in the result of the recognition process. The simulation experiments show that the algorithm can complete certain image processing operations with improved performance, not only simultaneously completing watermark detection and extraction, but also efficiently determining the watermark attribution. Compared with other state-of-the-art models, the proposed model obtains an optimal Peak Signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are a state-of-the-art technique for sequence learning. They are less commonly applied to financial time series predictions, yet inherently suitable for this domain. We deploy LSTM networks for predicting out-of-sample directional movements for the constituent stocks of the S&P 500 from 1992 until 2015. With daily returns of 0.46 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 5.8 prior to transaction costs, we find LSTM networks to outperform memory-free classification methods, i.e., a random forest (RAF), a deep neural net (DNN), and a logistic regression classifier (LOG). The outperformance relative to the general market is very clear from 1992 to 2009, but as of 2010, excess returns seem to have been arbitraged away with LSTM profitability fluctuating around zero after transaction costs. We further unveil sources of profitability, thereby shedding light into the black box of artificial neural networks. Specifically, we find one common pattern among the stocks selected for trading - they exhibit high volatility and a short-term reversal return profile. Leveraging these findings, we are able to formalize a rules-based short-term reversal strategy that yields 0.23 percent prior to transaction costs. Further regression analysis unveils low exposure of the LSTM returns to common sources of systematic risk also compared to the three benchmark models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Random forests (RF) is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which has recently started to gain prominence in water resources applications. However, existing applications are generally restricted to the implementation of Breiman's original algorithm for regression and classification problems, while numerous developments could be also useful in solving diverse practical problems in the water sector. Here we popularize RF and their variants for the practicing water scientist, and discuss related concepts and techniques, which have received less attention from the water science and hydrologic communities. In doing so, we review RF applications in water resources, highlight the potential of the original algorithm and its variants, and assess the degree of RF exploitation in a diverse range of applications. Relevant implementations of random forests, as well as related concepts and techniques in the R programming language, are also covered.

AB Part of the challenge for quantum many-body problems comes from the difficulty of representing large-scale quantum states, which in general requires an exponentially large number of parameters. Neural networks provide a powerful tool to represent quantum many-body states. An important open question is what characterizes the representational power of deep and shallow neural networks, which is of fundamental interest due to the popularity of deep learning methods. Here, we give a proof that, assuming a widely believed computational complexity conjecture, a deep neural network can efficiently represent most physical states, including the ground states of many-body Hamiltonians and states generated by quantum dynamics, while a shallow network representation with a restricted Boltzmann machine cannot efficiently represent some of those states.

AB Objective: Deep learning has become a promising approach for automated support for clinical diagnosis. When medical data samples are limited, collaboration among multiple institutions is necessary to achieve high algorithm performance. However, sharing patient data often has limitations due to technical, legal, or ethical concerns. In this study, we propose methods of distributing deep learning models as an attractive alternative to sharing patient data.
   Methods: We simulate the distribution of deep learning models across 4 institutions using various training heuristics and compare the results with a deep learning model trained on centrally hosted patient data. The training heuristics investigated include ensembling single institution models, single weight transfer, and cyclical weight transfer. We evaluated these approaches for image classification in 3 independent image collections (retinal fundus photos, mammography, and ImageNet).
   Results: We find that cyclical weight transfer resulted in a performance that was comparable to that of centrally hosted patient data. We also found that there is an improvement in the performance of cyclical weight transfer heuristic with a high frequency of weight transfer.
   Conclusions: We show that distributing deep learning models is an effective alternative to sharing patient data. This finding has implications for any collaborative deep learning study.

AB Recently, convolution neural network (CNN)-based hyperspectral image (HSI) classification has enjoyed high popularity due to its appealing performance. However, using 2-D or 3-D convolution in a standalone mode may be suboptimal in real applications. On the one hand, the 2-D convolution overlooks the spectral information in extracting feature maps. On the other hand, the 3-D convolution suffers from heavy computation in practice and seems to perform poorly in scenarios having analogous textures along with consecutive spectral bands. To solve these problems, we propose a mixed CNN with covariance pooling for HSI classification. Specifically, our network architecture starts with spectralspatial 3-D convolutions that followed by a spatial 2-D convolution. Through this mixture operation, we fuse the feature maps generated by 3-D convolutions along the spectral bands for providing complementary information and reducing the dimension of channels. In addition, the covariance pooling technique is adopted to fully extract the second-order information from spectralspatial feature maps. Motivated by the channel-wise attention mechanism, we further propose two principal component analysis (PCA)-involved strategies, channel-wise shift and channel-wise weighting, to highlight the importance of different spectral bands and recalibrate channel-wise feature response, which can effectively improve the classification accuracy and stability, especially in the case of limited sample size. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, we conduct classification experiments on three well-known HSI data sets, Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Salinas Scene. The experimental results show that our proposal, although with less parameters, achieves better accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods.

AB This paper presents a technique for motion detection that incorporates several innovative mechanisms. For example, our proposed technique stores, for each pixel, a set of values taken in the past at the same location or in the neighborhood. It then compares this set to the current pixel value in order to determine whether that pixel belongs to the background, and adapts the model by choosing randomly which values to substitute from the background model. This approach differs from those based upon the classical belief that the oldest values should be replaced first. Finally, when the pixel is found to be part of the background, its value is propagated into the background model of a neighboring pixel. We describe our method in full details (including pseudo-code and the parameter values used) and compare it to other background subtraction techniques. Efficiency figures show that our method outperforms recent and proven state-of-the-art methods in terms of both computation speed and detection rate. We also analyze the performance of a downscaled version of our algorithm to the absolute minimum of one comparison and one byte of memory per pixel. It appears that even such a simplified version of our algorithm performs better than mainstream techniques.

AB Intelligent multi-camera video surveillance is a multidisciplinary field related to computer vision, pattern recognition, signal processing, communication, embedded computing and image sensors. This paper reviews the recent development of relevant technologies from the perspectives of computer vision and pattern recognition. The covered topics include multi-camera calibration, computing the topology of camera networks, multi-camera tracking, object re-identification, multi-camera activity analysis and cooperative video surveillance both with active and static cameras. Detailed descriptions of their technical challenges and comparison of different solutions are provided. It emphasizes the connection and integration of different modules in various environments and application scenarios. According to the most recent works, some problems can be jointly solved in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy. With the fast development of surveillance systems, the scales and complexities of camera networks are increasing and the monitored environments are becoming more and more complicated and crowded. This paper discusses how to face these emerging challenges. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is putting healthcare systems across the world under unprecedented and increasing pressure according to the World Health Organization (WHO). With the advances in computer algorithms and especially Artificial Intelligence, the detection of this type of virus in the early stages will help in fast recovery and help in releasing the pressure off healthcare systems. In this paper, a GAN with deep transfer learning for coronavirus detection in chest X-ray images is presented. The lack of datasets for COVID-19 especially in chest X-rays images is the main motivation of this scientific study. The main idea is to collect all the possible images for COVID-19 that exists until the writing of this research and use the GAN network to generate more images to help in the detection of this virus from the available X-rays images with the highest accuracy possible. The dataset used in this research was collected from different sources and it is available for researchers to download and use it. The number of images in the collected dataset is 307 images for four different types of classes. The classes are the COVID-19, normal, pneumonia bacterial, and pneumonia virus. Three deep transfer models are selected in this research for investigation. The models are the Alexnet, Googlenet, and Restnet18. Those models are selected for investigation through this research as it contains a small number of layers on their architectures, this will result in reducing the complexity, the consumed memory and the execution time for the proposed model. Three case scenarios are tested through the paper, the first scenario includes four classes from the dataset, while the second scenario includes 3 classes and the third scenario includes two classes. All the scenarios include the COVID-19 class as it is the main target of this research to be detected. In the first scenario, the Googlenet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 80.6% in testing accuracy. In the second scenario, the Alexnet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 85.2% in testing accuracy, while in the third scenario which includes two classes (COVID-19, and normal), Googlenet is selected to be the main deep transfer model as it achieves 100% in testing accuracy and 99.9% in the validation accuracy. All the performance measurement strengthens the obtained results through the research.

AB How useful can machine learning be in a quantum laboratory? Here we raise the question of the potential of intelligent machines in the context of scientific research. A major motivation for the present work is the unknown reachability of various entanglement classes in quantum experiments. We investigate this question by using the projective simulation model, a physics-oriented approach to artificial intelligence. In our approach, the projective simulation system is challenged to design complex photonic quantum experiments that produce high-dimensional entangled multiphoton states, which are of high interest in modern quantum experiments. The artificial intelligence system learns to create a variety of entangled states and improves the efficiency of their realization. In the process, the system autonomously (re)discovers experimental techniques which are only now becoming standard in modern quantum optical experiments-a trait which was not explicitly demanded from the system but emerged through the process of learning. Such features highlight the possibility that machines could have a significantly more creative role in future research.

AB Air pollution (mainly PM2.5) is one of the main environmental problems about air quality. Air pollution prediction and early warning is a prerequisite for air pollution prevention and control. However, it is not easy to accurately predict the long-term trend because the collected PM2.5 data have complex nonlinearity with multiple components of different frequency characteristics. This study proposes a hybrid deep learning predictor, in which the PM2.5 data are decomposed into components by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) firstly, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) is built to classify all the components into a fixed number of groups based on the frequency characteristics. Then, a gated-recurrent-unit (GRU) network is trained for each group as the sub-predictor, and the results from the three GRUs are fused to obtain the prediction result. Experiments based on the PM2.5 data from Beijing verify the proposed model, and the prediction results show that the decomposition and classification can develop the accuracy of the proposed predictor for air pollution prediction greatly.

AB Determining the key parameters driving attention and choice at the point of sale is a challenging task. To address this challenge, we performed two studies employing eye-tracking (ET) as a methodological tool when varying the visual marketing stimuli in a lab-experimental setting and in real supermarket shelf, and thus, facing an important gap in the current body of literature the need to reconcile ET results from lab and field studies.
   The first study was conducted in lab settings and explored in a controlled manner the top-down (goal-directed) vs. bottom-up (stimulus-driven) mechanisms of attention and choice. The second study took a step further in investigating these mechanisms in real life settings, namely a supermarket shelf. In both studies the same assortment context was presented (i.e. eight products, four flavours of two brands each). The products varied on their level of healthfulness (i.e. nutrient profile) which was explicitly communicated with nutrition labelling formats displayed front of pack. Participants were asked to select either the healthiest product or a product on their preference (lab settings), and a product of their preference (in-store settings). Fixation duration, number of fixations, and the consumer's choice was recorded.
   The results show that Brand and Product flavour are leading criteria in driving attention and choice, i.e. the stronger brand and best selected product received higher number of fixations. The shopping goal and label formats also contributed to variation in observed patterns. Brand placement in combination with brand strength had a significant impact in the retail environment. Current outcomes demonstrate the potential of eye-tracking in consumer research, from lab to supermarket shelf. The advanced understanding we offer in attention patterns and consequent decision opens promising avenues in successfully applying marketing strategies to navigate consumers' attention and choice.

AB Background: Computer vision may aid in melanoma detection.
   Objective: We sought to compare melanoma diagnostic accuracy of computer algorithms to dermatologists using dermoscopic images.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using 100 randomly selected dermoscopic images (50 melanomas, 44 nevi, and 6 lentigines) from an international computer vision melanoma challenge dataset (n = 379), along with individual algorithm results from 25 teams. We used 5 methods (nonlearned and machine learning) to combine individual automated predictions into "fusion" algorithms. In a companion study, 8 dermatologists classified the lesions in the 100 images as either benign or malignant.
   Results: The average sensitivity and specificity of dermatologists in classification was 82% and 59%. At 82% sensitivity, dermatologist specificity was similar to the top challenge algorithm (59% vs. 62%, P =.68) but lower than the best-performing fusion algorithm (59% vs. 76%, P = .02). Receiver operating characteristic area of the top fusion algorithm was greater than the mean receiver operating characteristic area of dermatologists (0.86 vs. 0.71, P = .001).
   Limitations: The dataset lacked the full spectrum of skin lesions encountered in clinical practice, particularly banal lesions. Readers and algorithms were not provided clinical data (eg, age or lesion history/symptoms). Results obtained using our study design cannot be extrapolated to clinical practice.
   Conclusion: Deep learning computer vision systems classified melanoma dermoscopy images with accuracy that exceeded some but not all dermatologists.

AB We present O-CNN, an Octree-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for 3D shape analysis. Built upon the octree representation of 3D shapes, our method takes the average normal vectors of a 3D model sampled in the finest leaf octants as input and performs 3D CNN operations on the octants occupied by the 3D shape surface. We design a novel octree data structure to efficiently store the octant information and CNN features into the graphics memory and execute the entire O-CNN training and evaluation on the GPU. O-CNN supports various CNN structures and works for 3D shapes in different representations. By restraining the computations on the octants occupied by 3D surfaces, the memory and computational costs of the O-CNN grow quadratically as the depth of the octree increases, which makes the 3D CNN feasible for high-resolution 3D models. We compare the performance of the O-CNN with other existing 3D CNN solutions and demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of O-CNN in three shape analysis tasks, including object classification, shape retrieval, and shape segmentation.

AB With the development of the Internet, cyber-attacks are changing rapidly and the cyber security situation is not optimistic. This survey report describes key literature surveys on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods for network analysis of intrusion detection and provides a brief tutorial description of each ML/DL method. Papers representing each method were indexed, read, and summarized based on their temporal or thermal correlations. Because data are so important in ML/DL methods, we describe some of the commonly used network datasets used in ML/DL, discuss the challenges of using ML/DL for cybersecurity and provide suggestions for research directions.

AB Face-pose estimation aims at estimating the gazing direction with two-dimensional face images. It gives important communicative information and visual saliency. However, it is challenging because of lights, background, face orientations, and appearance visibility. Therefore, a descriptive representation of face images and mapping it to poses are critical. In this paper, we use multimodal data and propose a novel face-pose estimation framework named multitask manifold deep learning ((MDL)-D-2). It is based on feature extractionwith improved convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multimodal mapping relationship with multitask learning. In the proposed CNNs, manifold regularized convolutional layers learn the relationship between outputs of neurons in a low-rank space. Besides, in the proposed mapping relationship learning method, different modals of face representations are naturally combined by applying multitask learning with incoherent sparse and low-rank learning with a least-squares loss. Experimental results on three challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate the performance of (MDL)-D-2.

AB Land cover (LC) and land use (LU) have commonly been classified separately from remotely sensed imagery, without considering the intrinsically hierarchical and nested relationships between them. In this paper, for the first time, a highly novel Joint Deep Learning framework is proposed and demonstrated for LC and LU classification. The proposed Joint Deep Learning (JDL) model incorporates a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN), and is implemented via a Markov process involving iterative updating. In the JDL, LU classification conducted by the CNN is made conditional upon the LC probabilities predicted by the MLP. In turn, those LU probabilities together with the original imagery are re-used as inputs to the MLP to strengthen the spatial and spectral feature representations. This process of updating the MLP and CNN forms a joint distribution, where both LC and LU are classified simultaneously through iteration. The proposed JDL method provides a general framework within which the pixel-based MLP and the patch-based CNN provide mutually complementary information to each other, such that both are refined in the classification process through iteration. Given the well-known complexities associated with the classification of very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) imagery, the effectiveness of the proposed JDL was tested on aerial photography of two large urban and suburban areas in Great Britain (Southampton and Manchester). The JDL consistently demonstrated greatly increased accuracies with increasing iteration, not only for the LU classification, but for both the LC and LU classifications, achieving by far the greatest accuracies for each at around 10 iterations. The average overall classification accuracies were 90.18% for LC and 87.92% for LU for the two study sites, far higher than the initial accuracies and consistently outperforming benchmark comparators (three each for LC and LU classification). This research, thus, represents the first attempt to unify the remote sensing classification of LC (state; what is there?) and LU (function; what is going on there?), where previously each had been considered separately only. It, thus, has the potential to transform the way that LC and LU classification is undertaken in future. Moreover, it paves the way to address effectively the complex tasks of classifying LC and LU from VFSR remotely sensed imagery via joint reinforcement, and in an automatic manner.

AB IMPORTANCE Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects 34 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of stroke. A readily accessible means to continuously monitor for AF could prevent large numbers of strokes and death.
   OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a deep neural network to detect AF using smartwatch data.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this multinational cardiovascular remote cohort study coordinated at the University of California, San Francisco, smartwatches were used to obtain heart rate and step count data for algorithm development. A total of 9750 participants enrolled in the Health eHeart Study and 51 patients undergoing cardioversion at the University of California, San Francisco, were enrolled between February 2016 and March 2017. A deep neural network was trained using a method called heuristic pretraining in which the network approximated representations of the R-R interval (ie, time between heartbeats) without manual labeling of training data. Validation was performed against the reference standard 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) in a separate cohort of patients undergoing cardioversion. A second exploratory validation was performed using smartwatch data from ambulatory individuals against the reference standard of self-reported history of persistent AF. Data were analyzed from March 2017 to September 2017.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic C statistic for the algorithm to detect AF were generated based on the reference standard of 12-lead ECG-diagnosed AF.
   RESULTS Of the 9750 participants enrolled in the remote cohort, including 347 participants with AF, 6143 (63.0%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 42 (12) years. There were more than 139 million heart rate measurements on which the deep neural network was trained. The deep neural network exhibited a C statistic of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-1.00; P < .001) to detect AF against the reference standard 12-lead ECG-diagnosed AF in the external validation cohort of 51 patients undergoing cardioversion; sensitivity was 98.0% and specificity was 90.2%. In an exploratory analysis relying on self-report of persistent AF in ambulatory participants, the C statistic was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64-0.78); sensitivity was 67.7% and specificity was 67.6%.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This proof-of-concept study found that smartwatch photoplethysmography coupled with a deep neural network can passively detect AF but with some loss of sensitivity and specificity against a criterion-standard ECG. Further studies will help identify the optimal role for smartwatch-guided rhythm assessment.

AB Cybersecurity continues to be a serious issue for any sector in the cyberspace as the number of security breaches is increasing from time to time. It is known that thousands of zero-day attacks are continuously emerging because of the addition of various protocols mainly from Internet of Things (IoT). Most of these attacks are small variants of previously known cyber-attacks. This indicates that even advanced mechanisms such as traditional machine learning systems face difficulty of detecting these small mutants of attacks over time. On the other hand, the success of deep learning (DL) in various big data fields has drawn several interests in cybersecurity fields. The application of DL has been practical because of the improvement in CPU and neural network algorithms aspects. The use of DL for attack detection in the cyberspace could be a resilient mechanism to small mutations or novel attacks because of its high-level feature extraction capability. The self-taught and compression capabilities of deep learning architectures are key mechanisms for hidden pattern discovery from the training data so that attacks are discriminated from benign traffic. This research is aimed at adopting a new approach, deep learning, to cybersecurity to enable the detection of attacks in social internet of things. The performance of the deep model is compared against traditional machine learning approach, and distributed attack detection is evaluated against the centralized detection system. The experiments have shown that our distributed attack detection system is superior to centralized detection systems using deep learning model. It has also been demonstrated that the deep model is more effective in attack detection than its shallow counter parts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, machine learning techniques have been proved a promising tool for bearing fault diagnosis. However, in the traditional machine learning-based diagnosis methods, the fault features tend to be relatively simple and couldn't work well for different fault type once a specific feature extraction method is determined. Meanwhile, although deep learning techniques can adaptively extract more representative features from bearing fault data, they are generally computationally expensive with slow convergence speed. Even if some deep learning algorithms like Multi-Layer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) can get fast training speed by means of non-tuned training strategy, they are inevitably of randomness to some extents. To solve this problem, a new deep learning method called deep output kernel learning is proposed in this paper to conduct collaborative diagnosis of multiple bearing fault types. The initial motivation is using the structural domain information among multiple bearing fault types to improve the diagnosis model's generalization ability and robustness. By adopting ML-ELM as baseline algorithm, this paper firstly utilizes autoencoder to adaptively extract deep features, and then uses them to construct an objective function with output kernel regularizer. Finally, after solving this optimization problem, an output kernel matrix is obtained, and with this matrix, the final diagnosis model is built by fusing the multiple outputs of fault classifier. Experimental results on CWRU and IMS bearing data sets show that, compared to one state-of-the-art signal analysis method and eight typical machine learning-based diagnosis methods including four shallow learning algorithms and four deep learning algorithms, the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of bearing fault diagnosis in an acceptable time. Moreover, the results from the Kruskal-Wallis Test also indicate the proposed method has good numerical stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, these algorithms remain a 'black box' in terms of how they generate the predictions from the input data. Also, high-performance deep learning requires large, high-quality training datasets. Here, we report the development of an understandable deep-learning system that detects acute intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and classifies five ICH subtypes from unenhanced head computed-tomography scans. By using a dataset of only 904 cases for algorithm training, the system achieved a performance similar to that of expert radiologists in two independent test datasets containing 200 cases (sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 95%) and 196 cases (sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 95%). The system includes an attention map and a prediction basis retrieved from training data to enhance explainability, and an iterative process that mimics the workflow of radiologists. Our approach to algorithm development can facilitate the development of deep-learning systems for a variety of clinical applications and accelerate their adoption into clinical practice.

AB Earthquake prediction is a very important problem in seismology, the success of which can potentially save many human lives. Various kinds of technologies have been proposed to address this problem, such as mathematical analysis, machine learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines, and precursors signal study. Unfortunately, they usually do not have very good results due to the seemingly dynamic and unpredictable nature of earthquakes. In contrast, we notice that earthquakes are spatially and temporally correlated because of the crust movement. Therefore, earthquake prediction for a particular location should not be conducted only based on the history data in that location, but according to the history data in a larger area. In this paper, we employ a deep learning technique called long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn the spatio-temporal relationship among earthquakes in different locations and make predictions by taking advantage of that relationship. Simulation results show that the LSTM network with two-dimensional input developed in this paper is able to discover and exploit the spatio-temporal correlations among earthquakes to make better predictions than before.

AB The ability to process large amounts of data and to extract useful insights from data has revolutionised society. This phenomenon dubbed as Big Data has applications for a wide assortment of industries, including the construction industry. The construction industry already deals with large volumes of heterogeneous data; which is expected to increase exponentially as technologies such as sensor networks and the Internet of Things are commoditised. In this paper, we present a detailed survey of the literature, investigating the application of Big Data techniques in the construction industry. We reviewed related works published in the databases of American Association of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), and Elsevier Science Direct Digital Library. While the application of data analytics in the construction industry is not new, the adoption of Big Data technologies in this industry remains at a nascent stage and lags the broad uptake of these technologies in other fields. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive survey of Big Data techniques in the context of the construction industry. This paper fills the void and presents a wide-ranging interdisciplinary review of literature of fields such as statistics, data mining and warehousing, machine learning, and Big Data Analytics in the context of the construction industry. We discuss the current state of adoption of Big Data in the construction industry and discuss the future potential of such technologies across the multiple domain-specific sub-areas of the construction industry. We also propose open issues and directions for future work along with potential pitfalls associated with Big Data adoption in the industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. Most current electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are based on machine learning algorithms. There is a large diversity of classifier types that are used in this field, as described in our 2007 review paper. Now, approximately ten years after this review publication, many new algorithms have been developed and tested to classify EEG signals in BCIs. The time is therefore ripe for an updated review of EEG classification algorithms for BCIs. Approach. We surveyed the BCI and machine learning literature from 2007 to 2017 to identify the new classification approaches that have been investigated to design BCIs. We synthesize these studies in order to present such algorithms, to report how they were used for BCIs, what were the outcomes, and to identify their pros and cons. Main results. We found that the recently designed classification algorithms for EEG-based BCIs can be divided into four main categories: adaptive classifiers, matrix and tensor classifiers, transfer learning and deep learning, plus a few other miscellaneous classifiers. Among these, adaptive classifiers were demonstrated to be generally superior to static ones, even with unsupervised adaptation. Transfer learning can also prove useful although the benefits of transfer learning remain unpredictable. Riemannian geometry-based methods have reached state-of-the-art performances on multiple BCI problems and deserve to be explored more thoroughly, along with tensor-based methods. Shrinkage linear discriminant analysis and random forests also appear particularly useful for small training samples settings. On the other hand, deep learning methods have not yet shown convincing improvement over state-of-the-art BCI methods. Significance. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the modern classification algorithms used in EEG-based BCIs, presents the principles of these methods and guidelines on when and how to use them. It also identifies a number of challenges to further advance EEG classification in BCI.

AB The goals of the study were (a) to compare the instructional effectiveness of immersive virtual reality (VR) versus a desktop slideshow as media for teaching scientific knowledge, and (b) to examine the efficacy of adding a generative learning strategy to a VR lesson. In Experiment 1, college students viewed a biology lesson about how the human body works either in immersive VR or via a self-directed PowerPoint slideshow on a desktop computer. Based on interest theory, it was predicted that students who learned in immersive VR would report more positive ratings of interest and motivation and would score higher on a posttest covering material in the lesson. In contrast, based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, it was predicted that students who learned with a well-designed slideshow would score higher on a posttest, although they might not report higher levels of interest and motivation. The results showed that students who viewed the slideshow performed significantly better on the posttest than the VR group, but reported lower motivation, interest, and engagement ratings. In Experiment 2, students either viewed a segmented VR lesson and produced a written summary after each segment or viewed the original, continuous VR lesson as in Experiment 1. Students who summarized the lesson after each segment performed significantly better on the posttest and the groups did not differ on reported interest, engagement, and motivation. These results support the cognitive theory of multimedia learning and demonstrate the value of generative learning strategies in immersive VR environments.

AB The use of head-mounted displays (HMD) for virtual reality (VR) application-based purposes including therapy, rehabilitation, and training is increasing. Despite advancements in VR technologies, many users still experience sickness symptoms. VR sickness may be influenced by technological differences within HMDs such as resolution and refresh rate, however, VR content also plays a significant role. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the literature on HMDs that report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores to determine the impact of content. User factors associated with VR sickness were also examined. A systematic search was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Fifty-five articles met inclusion criteria, representing 3,016 participants (mean age range 19.5-80; 41% female). Findings show gaming content recorded the highest total SSQ mean 34.26 (95%CI 29.57-38.95). VR sickness profiles were also influenced by visual stimulation, locomotion and exposure times. Older samples (mean age >= 35 years) scored significantly lower total SSQ means than younger samples, however, these findings are based on a small evidence base as a limited number of studies included older users. No sex differences were found. Across all types of content, the pooled total SSQ mean was relatively high 28.00 (95%CI 24.66-31.35) compared with recommended SSQ cut-off scores. These findings are of relevance for informing future research and the application of VR in different contexts.

AB The implementation of clinical-decision support algorithms for medical imaging faces challenges with reliability and interpretability. Here, we establish a diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients with common treatable blinding retinal diseases. Our framework utilizes transfer learning, which trains a neural network with a fraction of the data of conventional approaches. Applying this approach to a dataset of optical coherence tomography images, we demonstrate performance comparable to that of human experts in classifying age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. We also provide a more transparent and interpretable diagnosis by highlighting the regions recognized by the neural network. We further demonstrate the general applicability of our AI system for diagnosis of pediatric pneumonia using chest X-ray images. This tool may ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral of these treatable conditions, thereby facilitating earlier treatment, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

ID VEHICLE DETECTION
AB Recently, the deep convolutional neural network has brought great improvements in object detection. However, the balance between high accuracy and high speed has always been a challenging task in multiclass object detection for large-scale remote sensing imagery. One-stage methods are more widely used because of their high efficiency but are limited by their performances on small object detection. In this article, we propose a unified framework called feature-merged single-shot detection (FMSSD) network, which aggregates the context information both in multiple scales and the same scale feature maps. First, our network leverages the atrous spatial feature pyramid (ASFP) module to fuse the context information in multiscale features by using feature pyramid and multiple atrous rates. Second, we propose a novel area-weighted loss function to pay more attention to small objects, while the replaced original loss treats all objects equally. We believe that small objects should be given more weight than large objects because they lose more information during training. Specifically, a monotonic decreasing function about the area is designed to add weights on the loss function. Extensive experiments on the DOTA data set and NWPU VHR-10 data set demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with high efficiency. We also build a new large-scale data set called AIR-OBJ data set from Google Earth and show the detection results of small objects, which validates the effectiveness on large-scale remote sensing imagery.

AB Gamification, the application of game elements to non-game settings, continues to grow in popularity as a method to increase student engagement in the classroom. We tested students across two courses, measuring their motivation, social comparison, effort satisfaction, learner empowerment, and academic performance at four points during a 16-week semester. One course received a gamified curriculum, featuring a leaderboard and badges, whereas the other course received the same curriculum without the gamified elements. Our results found that students in the gamified course showed less motivation, satisfaction, and empowerment over time than those in the non-gamified class. The effect of course type on students' final exam scores was mediated by students' levels of intrinsic motivation, with students in the gamified course showing less motivation and lower final exam scores than the non-gamified class. This suggests that some care should be taken when applying certain gamification mechanics to educational settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Because the collection of ground-truth labels is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, classifying hyperspectral images (HSIs) with few training samples is a challenging problem. In this letter, we propose a novel semisupervised algorithm for the classification of hyperspectral data by training a customized generative adversarial network (GAN) for hyperspectral data. The GAN constructs an adversarial game between a discriminator and a generator. The generator generates samples that are not distinguishable by the discriminator, and the discriminator determines whether or not a sample is composed of real data. We design a semisupervised framework for HSI data based on a 1-D GAN (HSGAN). This framework enables the automatic extraction of spectral features for HSI classification. When HSGAN is trained using unlabeled hyperspectral data, the generator can generate hyperspectral samples that are similar to the real data, while the discriminator contains the features, which can be used to classify hyperspectral data with only a small number of labeled samples. The performance of the HSGAN is evaluated on the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer image data, and the results show that the proposed framework achieves very promising results with a small number of labeled samples.

AB Deep learning (DL), a new generation of artificial neural network research, has transformed industries, daily lives, and various scientific disciplines in recent years. DL represents significant progress in the ability of neural networks to automatically engineer problem-relevant features and capture highly complex data distributions. I argue that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water sciences such as interdisciplinarity, data discoverability, hydrologic scaling, equifinality, and needs for parameter regionalization. This review paper is intended to provide water resources scientists and hydrologists in particular with a simple technical overview, transdisciplinary progress update, and a source of inspiration about the relevance of DL to water. The review reveals that various physical and geoscientific disciplines have utilized DL to address data challenges, improve efficiency, and gain scientific insights. DL is especially suited for information extraction from image-like data and sequential data. Techniques and experiences presented in other disciplines are of high relevance to water research. Meanwhile, less noticed is that DL may also serve as a scientific exploratory tool. A new area termed AI neuroscience, where scientists interpret the decision process of deep networks and derive insights, has been born. This budding subdiscipline has demonstrated methods including correlation-based analysis, inversion of network-extracted features, reduced-order approximations by interpretable models, and attribution of network decisions to inputs. Moreover, DL can also use data to condition neurons that mimic problem-specific fundamental organizing units, thus revealing emergent behaviors of these units. Vast opportunities exist for DL to propel advances in water sciences.

AB Video captioning, in essential, is a complex natural process, which is affected by various uncertainties stemming from video content, subjective judgment, and so on. In this paper, we build on the recent progress in using encoder-decoder framework for video captioning and address what we find to be a critical deficiency of the existing methods that most of the decoders propagate deterministic hidden states. Such complex uncertainty cannot be modeled efficiently by the deterministic models. In this paper, we propose a generative approach, referred to as multimodal stochastic recurrent neural networks (MS-RNNs), which models the uncertainty observed in the data using latent stochastic variables. Therefore, MS-RNN can improve the performance of video captioning and generate multiple sentences to describe a video considering different random factors. Specifically, a multimodal long short-term memory (LSTM) is first proposed to interact with both visual and textual features to capture a high-level representation. Then, a backward stochastic LSTM is proposed to support uncertainty propagation by introducing latent variables. Experimental results on the challenging data sets, microsoft video description and microsoft research videoto-text, show that our proposed MS-RNN approach outperforms the state-of-the-art video captioning benchmarks.

AB Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black-box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use-case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system This article is categorized under: Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Human Centricity and User Interaction

AB In this paper we unpack and examine attitudes and potential barriers of end-users towards the self-driving car. We explore whether drivers have (mental) barriers and/or show resistance towards the self-driving car and, given such barriers and resistance are identified, investigate the main underlying reasons. Further, we suggest potential strategic implications for automotive companies and avenues to overcome, or at least mitigate, drivers' barriers. The paper contributes to a better understanding of end-users' opinions on radical innovations such as the self-driving car and strives to add value by linking scientific insights from both psychology as well as innovation literature. Only a limited number of studies so far have dealt with the potential barriers of users towards the self-driving car; therefore, it is our intent to provide first empirical evidence to trigger further research and foster a broader discussion on this relevant topic.

AB It is currently estimated that about 30% of children with autism spectrum disorder remain minimally verbal, even after receiving years of interventions and a range of educational opportunities. Very little is known about the individuals at this end of the autism spectrum, in part because this is a highly variable population with no single set of defining characteristics or patterns of skills or deficits, and in part because it is extremely challenging to provide reliable or valid assessments of their developmental functioning. In this paper, we summarize current knowledge based on research including minimally verbal children. We review promising new novel methods for assessing the verbal and nonverbal abilities of minimally verbal school-aged children, including eye-tracking and brain-imaging methods that do not require overt responses. We then review what is known about interventions that may be effective in improving language and communication skills, including discussion of both nonaugmentative and augmentative methods. In the final section of the paper, we discuss the gaps in the literature and needs for future research. Autism Res 2013, 6: 468-478.

AB The next-generation wireless networks are evolving into very complex systems because of the very diversified service requirements, heterogeneity in applications, devices, and networks. The network operators need to make the best use of the available resources, for example, power, spectrum, as well as infrastructures. Traditional networking approaches, i.e., reactive, centrally-managed, one-size-fits-all approaches, and conventional data analysis tools that have limited capability (space and time) are not competent anymore and cannot satisfy and serve that future complex networks regarding operation and optimization cost effectively. A novel paradigm of proactive, self-aware, self-adaptive, and predictive networking is much needed. The network operators have access to large amounts of data, especially from the network and the subscribers. Systematic exploitation of the big data dramatically helps in making the system smart, intelligent, and facilitates efficient as well as cost-effective operation and optimization. We envision data-driven next-generation wireless networks, where the network operators employ advanced data analytics, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence. We discuss the data sources and strong drivers for the adoption of the data analytics, and the role of ML, artificial intelligence in making the system intelligent regarding being self-aware, self-adaptive, proactive and prescriptive. A set of network design and optimization schemes are presented concerning data analytics. This paper concludes with a discussion of challenges and the benefits of adopting big data analytics, ML, and artificial intelligence in the next-generation communication systems.

AB Computational modeling of chemical and biological systems at atomic resolution is a crucial tool in the chemist's toolset. The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.

AB We demonstrate that a deep neural network can significantly improve optical microscopy, enhancing its spatial resolution over a large field of view and depth of field. After its training, the only input to this network is an image acquired using a regular optical microscope, without any changes to its design. We blindly tested this deep learning approach using various tissue samples that are imaged with low-resolution and wide-field systems, where the network rapidly outputs an image with better resolution, matching the performance of higher numerical aperture lenses and also significantly surpassing their limited field of view and depth of field. These results are significant for various fields that use microscopy tools, including, e.g., life sciences, where optical microscopy is considered as one of the most widely used and deployed techniques. Beyond such applications, the presented approach might be applicable to other imaging modalities, also spanning different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and can be used to design computational imagers that get better as they continue to image specimens and establish new transformations among different modes of imaging.

AB As an emerging training model with neural networks, federated learning has received widespread attention due to its ability to update parameters without collecting users' raw data. However, since adversaries can track and derive participants' privacy from the shared gradients, federated learning is still exposed to various security and privacy threats. In this paper, we consider two major issues in the training process over deep neural networks (DNNs): 1) how to protect user's privacy (i.e., local gradients) in the training process and 2) how to verify the integrity (or correctness) of the aggregated results returned from the server. To solve the above problems, several approaches focusing on secure or privacy-preserving federated learning have been proposed and applied in diverse scenarios. However, it is still an open problem enabling clients to verify whether the cloud server is operating correctly, while guaranteeing user's privacy in the training process. In this paper, we propose VerifyNet, the first privacy-preserving and verifiable federated learning framework. In specific, we first propose a double-masking protocol to guarantee the confidentiality of users' local gradients during the federated learning. Then, the cloud server is required to provide the Proof about the correctness of its aggregated results to each user. We claim that it is impossible that an adversary can deceive users by forging Proof, unless it can solve the NP-hard problem adopted in our model. In addition, VerifyNet is also supportive of users dropping out during the training process. The extensive experiments conducted on real-world data also demonstrate the practical performance of our proposed scheme.

TI DANN: a deep learning approach for annotating the pathogenicity of
   genetic variants
SO BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
AB The Summary: Annotating genetic variants, especially non-coding variants, for the purpose of identifying pathogenic variants remains a challenge. Combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) is an algorithm designed to annotate both coding and non-coding variants, and has been shown to outperform other annotation algorithms. CADD trains a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) to differentiate evolutionarily derived, likely benign, alleles from simulated, likely deleterious, variants. However, SVMs cannot capture non-linear relationships among the features, which can limit performance. To address this issue, we have developed DANN. DANN uses the same feature set and training data as CADD to train a deep neural network (DNN). DNNs can capture non-linear relationships among features and are better suited than SVMs for problems with a large number of samples and features. We exploit Compute Unified Device Architecture-compatible graphics processing units and deep learning techniques such as dropout and momentum training to accelerate the DNN training. DANN achieves about a 19% relative reduction in the error rate and about a 14% relative increase in the area under the curve (AUC) metric over CADD's SVM methodology.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT)-centric concepts like augmented reality, high-resolution video streaming, self-driven cars, smart environment, e-health care, etc. have a ubiquitous presence now. These applications require higher data-rates, large bandwidth, increased capacity, low latency and high throughput. In light of these emerging concepts, IoT has revolutionized the world by providing seamless connectivity between heterogeneous networks (HetNets). The eventual aim of IoT is to introduce the plug and play technology providing the end-user, ease of operation, remotely access control and configurability. This paper presents the IoT technology from a bird's eye view covering its statistical/architectural trends, use cases, challenges and future prospects. The paper also presents a detailed and extensive overview of the emerging 5G-IoT scenario. Fifth Generation (5G) cellular networks provide key enabling technologies for ubiquitous deployment of the IoT technology. These include carrier aggregation, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), massive-MIMO (M-MIMO), coordinated multipoint processing (CoMP), device-to-device (D2D) communications, centralized radio access network (CRAN), software-defined wireless sensor networking (SD-WSN), network function virtualization (NFV) and cognitive radios (CRs). This paper presents an exhaustive review for these key enabling technologies and also discusses the new emerging use cases of 5G-IoT driven by the advances in artificial intelligence, machine and deep learning, ongoing 5G initiatives, quality of service (QoS) requirements in 5G and its standardization issues. Finally, the paper discusses challenges in the implementation of 5G-IoT due to high data-rates requiring both cloud-based platforms and IoT devices based edge computing.

DE Deep neural networks; convolutional neural networks; image recognition
AB This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the majority of the deep neural networks (DNNs) proposed in the state of the art for image recognition. For each DNN, multiple performance indices are observed, such as recognition accuracy, model complexity, computational complexity, memory usage, and inference time. The behavior of such performance indices and some combinations of them are analyzed and discussed. To measure the indices, we experiment the use of DNNs on two different computer architectures, a workstation equipped with a NVIDIA Titan X Pascal, and an embedded system based on a NVIDIA Jetson TX1 board. This experimentation allows a direct comparison between DNNs running on machines with very different computational capacities. This paper is useful for researchers to have a complete view of what solutions have been explored so far and in which research directions are worth exploring in the future, and for practitioners to select the DNN architecture(s) that better fit the resource constraints of practical deployments and applications. To complete this work, all the DNNs, as well as the software used for the analysis, are available online.

ID RESOURCE-ALLOCATION
AB Wireless powered mobile-edge computing (MEC) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance the data processing capability of low-power networks, such as wireless sensor networks and internet of things (IoT). In this paper, we consider a wireless powered MEC network that adopts a binary offloading policy, so that each computation task of wireless devices (WDs) is either executed locally or fully offloaded to an MEC server. Our goal is to acquire an online algorithm that optimally adapts task offloading decisions and wireless resource allocations to the time-varying wireless channel conditions. This requires quickly solving hard combinatorial optimization problems within the channel coherence time, which is hardly achievable with conventional numerical optimization methods. To tackle this problem, we propose a Deep Reinforcement learning-based Online Offloading (DROO) framework that implements a deep neural network as a scalable solution that learns the binary offloading decisions from the experience. It eliminates the need of solving combinatorial optimization problems, and thus greatly reduces the computational complexity especially in large-size networks. To further reduce the complexity, we propose an adaptive procedure that automatically adjusts the parameters of the DROO algorithm on the fly. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance while significantly decreasing the computation time by more than an order of magnitude compared with existing optimization methods. For example, the CPU execution latency of DROO is less than 0.1 second in a 30-user network, making real-time and optimal offloading truly viable even in a fast fading environment.

AB In this paper, a novel modeling framework for forecasting electricity prices is proposed. While many predictive models have been already proposed to perform this task, the area of deep learning algorithms remains yet unexplored. To fill this scientific gap, we propose four different deep learning models for predicting electricity prices and we show how they lead to improvements in predictive accuracy. In addition, we also consider that, despite the large number of proposed methods for predicting electricity prices, an extensive benchmark is still missing. To tackle that, we compare and analyze the accuracy of 27 common approaches for electricity price forecasting. Based on the benchmark results, we show how the proposed deep learning models outperform the state-of-the-art methods and obtain results that are statistically significant. Finally, using the same results, we also show that: (i) machine learning methods yield, in general, a better accuracy than statistical models; (ii) moving average terms do not improve the predictive accuracy; (iii) hybrid models do not outperform their simpler counterparts.

AB Wearable robots based on soft materials will augment mobility and performance of the host without restricting natural kinematics. Such wearable robots will need soft sensors to monitor the movement of the wearer and robot outside the lab. Until now wearable soft sensors have not demonstrated significant mechanical robustness nor been systematically characterized for human motion studies of walking and running. Here, we present the design and systematic characterization of a soft sensing suit for monitoring hip, knee, and ankle sagittal plane joint angles. We used hyper-elastic strain sensors based on microchannels of liquid metal embedded within elastomer, but refined their design with the use of discretized stiffness gradients to improve mechanical durability. We found that these robust sensors could stretch up to 396% of their original lengths, would restrict the wearer by less than 0.17% of any given joint's torque, had gauge factor sensitivities of greater than 2.2, and exhibited less than 2% change in electromechanical specifications through 1500 cycles of loading-unloading. We also evaluated the accuracy and variability of the soft sensing suit by comparing it with joint angle data obtained through optical motion capture. The sensing suit had root mean square (RMS) errors of less than 5 degrees for a walking speed of 0.89m/s and reached a maximum RMS error of 15 degrees for a running speed of 2.7m/s. Despite the deviation of absolute measure, the relative repeatability of the sensing suit's joint angle measurements were statistically equivalent to that of optical motion capture at all speeds. We anticipate that wearable soft sensing will also have applications beyond wearable robotics, such as in medical diagnostics and in human-computer interaction.

AB In virtual reality (VR), users can experience symptoms of motion sickness, which is referred to as VR sickness or cybersickness. The symptoms include but are not limited to eye fatigue, disorientation, and nausea, which can impair the VR experience of users. Though many studies have attempted to reduce the discomfort, they produced conflicting results with varying degrees of VR sickness. In particular, a visually improved VR does not necessarily result in decreased VR sickness. To understand these unexpected results, we surveyed the causes of VR sickness and measurement of symptoms. We reorganized the causes of the VR sickness into three major factors (hardware, content, and human factors) and investigated the sub-component of each factor. We then surveyed frequently used measures of VR sickness, both subjective and objective approaches. We also investigated emerging approaches for reducing VR sickness and proposed a multimodal fidelity hypothesis to give an insight into future studies.

AB Asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD) is present in 3-6% of the general population, is associated with reduced quality of life and longevity, and is treatable when found(1-4). An inexpensive, noninvasive screening tool for ALVD in the doctor's office is not available. We tested the hypothesis that application of artificial intelligence (AI) to the electrocardiogram (ECG), a routine method of measuring the heart's electrical activity, could identify ALVD. Using paired 12-lead ECG and echocardiogram data, including the left ventricular ejection fraction (a measure of contractile function), from 44,959 patients at the Mayo Clinic, we trained a convolutional neural network to identify patients with ventricular dysfunction, defined as ejection fraction <= 35%, using the ECG data alone. When tested on an independent set of 52,870 patients, the network model yielded values for the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.93, 86.3%, 85.7%, and 85.7%, respectively. In patients without ventricular dysfunction, those with a positive AI screen were at 4 times the risk (hazard ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 3.3 to 5.0) of developing future ventricular dysfunction compared with those with a negative screen. Application of AI to the ECG-a ubiquitous, low-cost test-permits the ECG to serve as a powerful screening tool in asymptomatic individuals to identify ALVD.

AB A good prediction of landslide displacement is an essential component for implementing an early warning system. In the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA), many landslides deform distinctly and in steps from April to September each year under the influence of seasonal rainfall and periodic fluctuation in reservoir water level. The sliding becomes more uniform again from October to April. This landslide deformation pattern leads to accumulated displacement versus time showing a step-wise curve. Most of the existing predictive models express static relationships only. However, the evolution of a landslide is a complex nonlinear dynamic process. This paper proposes a dynamic model to predict landslide displacement, based on time series analysis and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. The accumulated displacement was decomposed into a trend term and a periodic term in the time series analysis. A cubic polynomial function was selected to predict the trend displacement. By analyzing the relationships between landslide deformation, rainfall, and reservoir water level, a LSTM model was used to predict the periodic displacement. The LSTM approach was found to properly model the dynamic characteristics of landslides than static models, and make full use of the historical information. The performance of the model was validated with the observations of two step-wise landslides in the TGRA, the Baishuihe landslide and Bazimen landslide. The application of the model to those two landslides demonstrates that the LSTM model provides a good representation of the measured displacements and gives a more reliable prediction of landslide displacement than the static support vector machine (SVM) model. It is concluded that the proposed model can be used to effectively predict the displacement of step-wise landslides in the TGRA.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, have the potential to significantly reduce the cost and time of making last-mile deliveries and responding to emergencies. Despite this potential, little work has gone into developing vehicle routing problems (VRPs) specifically for drone delivery scenarios. Existing VRPs are insufficient for planning drone deliveries: either multiple trips to the depot are not permitted, leading to solutions with excess drones, or the effect of battery and payload weight on energy consumption is not considered, leading to costly or infeasible routes. We propose two multitrip VRPs for drone delivery that address both issues. One minimizes costs subject to a delivery time limit, while the other minimizes the overall delivery time subject to a budget constraint. We mathematically derive and experimentally validate an energy consumption model for multirotor drones, demonstrating that energy consumption varies approximately linearly with payload and battery weight. We use this approximation to derive mixed integer linear programs for our VRPs. We propose a cost function that considers our energy consumption model and drone reuse, and apply it in a simulated annealing (SA) heuristic for finding suboptimal solutions to practical scenarios. To assist drone delivery practitioners with balancing cost and delivery time, the SA heuristic is used to show that the minimum cost has an inverse exponential relationship with the delivery time limit, and the minimum overall delivery time has an inverse exponential relationship with the budget. Numerical results confirm the importance of reusing drones and optimizing battery size in drone delivery VRPs.

AB Ground reference data are an essential prerequisite for supervised crop mapping. The lack of a low-cost and efficient ground referencing method results in pervasively limited reference data and hinders crop classification. In this study, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to explore the efficacy of automatic ground truthing via Google Street View (GSV) images in two distinct farming regions: Illinois and the Central Valley in California. We demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of our new ground referencing technique by performing pixel-based crop mapping at the state level using the cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform. The mapping results are evaluated using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop data layer (CDL) products. From similar to 130,000 GSV images, the CNN model identified similar to 9,400 target crop images. These images are well classified into crop types, including alfalfa, almond, corn, cotton, grape, rice, soybean, and pistachio. The overall GSV image classification accuracy is 92% for the Central Valley and 97% for Illinois. Subsequently, we shifted the image geographical coordinates 2-3 times in a certain direction to produce 31,829 crop reference points: 17,358 in Illinois, and 14,471 in the Central Valley. Evaluation of the mapping results with CDL products revealed satisfactory coherence. GSV-derived mapping results capture the general pattern of crop type distributions for 2011-2019. The overall agreement between CDL products and our mapping results is indicated by R-2 values of 0.44-0.99 for the Central Valley and 0.81-0.98 for Illinois. To show the applicational value of the proposed method in other countries, we further mapped rice paddy (2014-2018) in South Korea which yielded fairly well outcomes (R-2 = 0.91). These results indicate that GSV images used with a deep learning model offer an efficient and cost-effective alternative method for ground referencing, in many regions of the world.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been regarded to be an emerging solution for the next generation of communications, in which hybrid analog and digital precoding is an important method for reducing the hardware complexity and energy consumption associated with mixed signal components. However, the fundamental limitations of the existing hybrid precoding schemes are that they have high-computational complexity and fail to fully exploit the spatial information. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a deep-learning-enabled mmWave massive MIMO framework for effective hybrid precoding, in which each selection of the precoders for obtaining the optimized decoder is regarded as a mapping relation in the deep neural network (DNN). Specifically, the hybrid precoder is selected through training based on the DNN for optimizing precoding process of the mmWave massive MIMO. Additionally, we present extensive simulation results to validate the excellent performance of the proposed scheme. The results exhibit that the DNN-based approach is capable of minimizing the bit error ratio and enhancing the spectrum efficiency of the mmWave massive MIMO, which achieves better performance in hybrid precoding compared with conventional schemes while substantially reducing the required computational complexity.

AB Recent progress on salient object detection is substantial, benefiting mostly from the explosive development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Semantic segmentation and salient object detection algorithms developed lately have been mostly based on Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs). There is still a large room for improvement over the generic FCN models that do not explicitly deal with the scale-space problem. The Holistically-Nested Edge Detector (HED) provides a skip-layer structure with deep supervision for edge and boundary detection, but the performance gain of HED on saliency detection is not obvious. In this paper, we propose a new salient object detection method by introducing short connections to the skip-layer structures within the HED architecture. Our framework takes full advantage of multi-level and multi-scale features extracted from FCNs, providing more advanced representations at each layer, a property that is critically needed to perform segment detection. Our method produces state-of-the-art results on 5 widely tested salient object detection benchmarks, with advantages in terms of efficiency (0.08 seconds per image), effectiveness, and simplicity over the existing algorithms. Beyond that, we conduct an exhaustive analysis of the role of training data on performance. We provide a training set for future research and fair comparisons.

In the DTL method, three transfer strategies, that is, weight transfer, transfer learning of hidden feature, and weight update, are used to transfer an SAE trained by historical failure data to a new object. By these strategies, prediction of the new object without supervised information for training is achieved. Moreover, the learned features by deep transfer network for the new object share joint and similar characteristic to that of historical failure data, which is beneficial to accurate prediction. Case study on remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of cutting tool is performed to validate effectiveness of the DTL method. An SAE network is first trained by run-to-failure data with RUL information of a cutting tool in an off-line process. The trained network is then transferred to a new tool under operation for on-line RUL prediction. The prediction result with high accuracy shows advantage of the DTL method for RUL prediction.

AB Convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated impressive ability to represent hyperspectral images and to achieve promising results in hyperspectral image classification. However, traditional CNN models can only operate convolution on regular square image regions with fixed size and weights, and thus, they cannot universally adapt to the distinct local regions with various object distributions and geometric appearances. Therefore, their classification performances are still to be improved, especially in class boundaries. To alleviate this shortcoming, we consider employing the recently proposed graph convolutional network (GCN) for hyperspectral image classification, as it can conduct the convolution on arbitrarily structured non-Euclidean data and is applicable to the irregular image regions represented by graph topological information. Different from the commonly used GCN models that work on a fixed graph, we enable the graph to be dynamically updated along with the graph convolution process so that these two steps can be benefited from each other to gradually produce the discriminative embedded features as well as a refined graph. Moreover, to comprehensively deploy the multiscale information inherited by hyperspectral images, we establish multiple input graphs with different neighborhood scales to extensively exploit the diversified spectral-spatial correlations at multiple scales. Therefore, our method is termed multiscale dynamic GCN (MDGCN). The experimental results on three typical benchmark data sets firmly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MDGCN to other state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative aspects.

AB In this paper, an adaptive sliding mode control system using a double loop recurrent neural network (DLRNN) structure is proposed for a class of nonlinear dynamic systems. A new three-layer RNN is proposed to approximate unknown dynamics with two different kinds of feedback loops where the firing weights and output signal calculated in the last step are stored and used as the feedback signals in each feedback loop. Since the new structure has combined the advantages of internal feedback NN and external feedback NN, it can acquire the internal state information while the output signal is also captured, thus the new designed DLRNN can achieve better approximation performance compared with the regular NNs without feedback loops or the regular RNNs with a single feedback loop. The new proposed DLRNN structure is employed in an equivalent controller to approximate the unknown nonlinear system dynamics, and the parameters of the DLRNN are updated online by adaptive laws to get favorable approximation performance. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, the designed adaptive sliding mode controller with the DLRNN is applied to a z-axis microelectromechanical system gyroscope to control the vibrating dynamics of the proof mass. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can achieve good tracking property, and the comparisons of the approximation performance between radial basis function NN, RNN, and DLRNN show that the DLRNN can accurately estimate the unknown dynamics with a fast speed while the internal states of DLRNN are more stable.

AB OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this article are to describe concepts that radiologists should understand to evaluate machine learning projects, including common algorithms, supervised as opposed to unsupervised techniques, statistical pitfalls, and data considerations for training and evaluation, and to briefly describe ethical dilemmas and legal risk.
   CONCLUSION. Machine learning includes a broad class of computer programs that improve with experience. The complexity of creating, training, and monitoring machine learning indicates that the success of the algorithms will require radiologist involvement for years to come, leading to engagement rather than replacement.

AB Background In general, academic but not community endoscopists have demonstrated adequate endoscopic differentiation accuracy to make the 'resect and discard' paradigm for diminutive colorectal polyps workable. Computer analysis of video could potentially eliminate the obstacle of interobserver variability in endoscopic polyp interpretation and enable widespread acceptance of 'resect and discard'.
   Study design and methods We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model for real-time assessment of endoscopic video images of colorectal polyps. A deep convolutional neural network model was used. Only narrow band imaging video frames were used, split equally between relevant multiclasses. Unaltered videos from routine exams not specifically designed or adapted for AI classification were used to train and validate the model. The model was tested on a separate series of 125 videos of consecutively encountered diminutive polyps that were proven to be adenomas or hyperplastic polyps.
   Results T he AI model works with a confidence mechanism and did not generate sufficient confidence to predict the histology of 19 polyps in the test set, representing 15% of the polyps. For the remaining 106 diminutive polyps, the accuracy of the model was 94% (95% CI 86% to 97%), the sensitivity for identification of adenomas was 98% (95% CI 92% to 100%), specificity was 83% (95% CI 67% to 93%), negative predictive value 97% and positive predictive value 90%.
   Conclusions A n AI model trained on endoscopic video can differentiate diminutive adenomas from hyperplastic polyps with high accuracy. Additional study of this programme in a live patient clinical trial setting to address resect and discard is planned.

ID VIEW CLASSIFICATION; UNITED-STATES; DEEP; ASSOCIATION; DISEASE; CANCER
AB Background: Automated cardiac image interpretation has the potential to transform clinical practice in multiple ways, including enabling serial assessment of cardiac function by nonexperts in primary care and rural settings. We hypothesized that advances in computer vision could enable building a fully automated, scalable analysis pipeline for echocardiogram interpretation, including (1) view identification, (2) image segmentation, (3) quantification of structure and function, and (4) disease detection.
   Methods: Using 14035 echocardiograms spanning a 10-year period, we trained and evaluated convolutional neural network models for multiple tasks, including automated identification of 23 viewpoints and segmentation of cardiac chambers across 5 common views. The segmentation output was used to quantify chamber volumes and left ventricular mass, determine ejection fraction, and facilitate automated determination of longitudinal strain through speckle tracking. Results were evaluated through comparison to manual segmentation and measurements from 8666 echocardiograms obtained during the routine clinical workflow. Finally, we developed models to detect 3 diseases: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloid, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
   Results: Convolutional neural networks accurately identified views (eg, 96% for parasternal long axis), including flagging partially obscured cardiac chambers, and enabled the segmentation of individual cardiac chambers. The resulting cardiac structure measurements agreed with study report values (eg, median absolute deviations of 15% to 17% of observed values for left ventricular mass, left ventricular diastolic volume, and left atrial volume). In terms of function, we computed automated ejection fraction and longitudinal strain measurements (within 2 cohorts), which agreed with commercial software-derived values (for ejection fraction, median absolute deviation=9.7% of observed, N=6407 studies; for strain, median absolute deviation=7.5%, n=419, and 9.0%, n=110) and demonstrated applicability to serial monitoring of patients with breast cancer for trastuzumab cardiotoxicity. Overall, we found automated measurements to be comparable or superior to manual measurements across 11 internal consistency metrics (eg, the correlation of left atrial and ventricular volumes). Finally, we trained convolutional neural networks to detect hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac amyloidosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension with C statistics of 0.93, 0.87, and 0.85, respectively.
   Conclusions: Our pipeline lays the groundwork for using automated interpretation to support serial patient tracking and scalable analysis of millions of echocardiograms archived within healthcare systems.

AB The advent of computer graphic processing units, improvement in mathematical models and availability of big data has allowed artificial intelligence (AI) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to achieve robust performance for broad applications in social-media, the intemet of things, the automotive industry and healthcare. DL systems in particular provide improved capability in image, speech and motion recognition as well as in natural language processing. In medicine, significant progress of AI and DL systems has been demonstrated in image-centric specialties such as radiology, dermatology, pathology and ophthalmology. New studies, including pre-registered prospective clinical trials, have shown DL systems are accurate and effective in detecting diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity, refractive error and in identifying cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, from digital fundus photographs. There is also increasing attention on the use of AI and DL systems in identifying disease features, progression and treatment response for retinal diseases such as neovascular AMD and diabetic macular edema using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, the application of ML to visual fields may be useful in detecting glaucoma progression. There are limited studies that incorporate clinical data including electronic health records, in AL and DL algorithms, and no prospective studies to demonstrate that AI and DL algorithms can predict the development of clinical eye disease. This article describes global eye disease burden, unmet needs and common conditions of public health importance for which AI and DL systems may be applicable. Technical and clinical aspects to build a DL system to address those needs, and the potential challenges for clinical adoption are discussed. AI, ML and DL will likely play a crucial role in clinical ophthalmology practice, with implications for screening, diagnosis and follow up of the major causes of vision impairment in the setting of ageing populations globally.

AB In recent years, deep learning based methods have attracted broad attention in the field of hyperspectral image classification. However, due to the massive parameters and the complex network structure, deep learning methods may not perform well when only few training samples are available. In this paper, we propose a small-scale data based method, multi-grained network (MugNet), to explore the application of deep learning approaches in hyperspectral image classification. MugNet could be considered as a simplified deep learning model which mainly targets at limited samples based hyperspectral image classification. Three novel strategies are proposed to construct MugNet. First, the spectral relationship among different bands, as well as the spatial correlation within neighboring pixels, are both utilized via a multi-grained scanning approach. The proposed multi-grained scanning strategy could not only extract the joint spectral-spatial information, but also combine different grains' spectral and spatial relationship. Second, because there are abundant unlabeled pixels available in hyperspectral images, we take full advantage of these samples, and adopt a semi-supervised manner in the process of generating convolution kernels. At last, the MugNet is built upon the basis of a very simple network which does not include many hyperparameters for tuning. The performance of MugNet is evaluated on a popular and two challenging data sets, and comparison experiments with several state-of-the-art hyperspectral image classification methods are revealed.

AB Goal: To develop a robust and real-time approach for automatic detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings using deep learning (DL). Method: An end-to-end model combining the Convolutional- and Recurrent-Neural Networks (CNN and RNN) was proposed to extract high level features from segments of RR intervals (RRIs) in order to classify them as AF or normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Results: The model was trained and validated on three different databases including a total of 89 subjects. It achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 98.98% and 96.95%, respectively, validated through a 5-fold cross-validation. Additionally, the proposed model was found to be computationally efficient and it was capable of analyzing 24 h of ECG recordings in less than one second. The proposed algorithm was also tested on the unseen datasets to examine its robustness in detecting AF for new recordings which resulted in 98.96% and 86.04% for specificity and sensitivity, respectively. Conclusion: Compared to the state-of-the-art models evaluated on standard benchmark ECG datasets, the proposed model produced better performance in detecting AF. Additionally, since the model learns features directly from the data, it avoids the need for clever/cumbersome feature engineering. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundAbove-ground biomass (AGB) is a basic agronomic parameter for field investigation and is frequently used to indicate crop growth status, the effects of agricultural management practices, and the ability to sequester carbon above and below ground. The conventional way to obtain AGB is to use destructive sampling methods that require manual harvesting of crops, weighing, and recording, which makes large-area, long-term measurements challenging and time consuming. However, with the diversity of platforms and sensors and the improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, remote sensing is now regarded as the best technical means for monitoring and estimating AGB over large areas.ResultsIn this study, we used structural and spectral information provided by remote sensing from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in combination with machine learning to estimate maize biomass. Of the 14 predictor variables, six were selected to create a model by using a recursive feature elimination algorithm. Four machine-learning regression algorithms (multiple linear regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest) were evaluated and compared to create a suitable model, following which we tested whether the two sampling methods influence the training model. To estimate the AGB of maize, we propose an improved method for extracting plant height from UAV images and a volumetric indicator (i.e., BIOVP). The results show that (1) the random forest model gave the most balanced results, with low error and a high ratio of the explained variance for both the training set and the test set. (2) BIOVP can retain the largest strength effect on the AGB estimate in four different machine learning models by using importance analysis of predictors. (3) Comparing the plant heights calculated by the three methods with manual ground-based measurements shows that the proposed method increased the ratio of the explained variance and reduced errors.ConclusionsThese results lead us to conclude that the combination of machine learning with UAV remote sensing is a promising alternative for estimating AGB. This work suggests that structural and spectral information can be considered simultaneously rather than separately when estimating biophysical crop parameters.

AB The ventral visual stream underlies key human visual object recognition abilities. However, neural encoding in the higher areas of the ventral stream remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a modeling approach that yields a quantitatively accurate model of inferior temporal (IT) cortex, the highest ventral cortical area. Using high-throughput computational techniques, we discovered that, within a class of biologically plausible hierarchical neural network models, there is a strong correlation between a model's categorization performance and its ability to predict individual IT neural unit response data. To pursue this idea, we then identified a high-performing neural network that matches human performance on a range of recognition tasks. Critically, even though we did not constrain this model to match neural data, its top output layer turns out to be highly predictive of IT spiking responses to complex naturalistic images at both the single site and population levels. Moreover, the model's intermediate layers are highly predictive of neural responses in the V4 cortex, a midlevel visual area that provides the dominant cortical input to IT. These results show that performance optimization-applied in a biologically appropriate model class-can be used to build quantitative predictive models of neural processing.

AB Most recent research of deep neural networks in the field of computer vision has focused on improving performances of point predictions by developing network architectures or learning algorithms. Reliable uncertainty quantification accompanied by point estimation can lead to a more informed decision, and the quality of prediction can be improved. In this paper, we invoke a Bayesian neural network and propose a natural way of quantifying uncertainties in classification problems by decomposing the moment-based predictive uncertainty into two parts: aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The proposed method takes into account the discrete nature of the outcome, yielding the correct interpretation of each uncertainty. We demonstrate that the proposed uncertainty quantification method provides additional insights into the point prediction using two Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation Challenge datasets and the Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction dataset.

AB In this paper, we present a new face detection scheme using deep learning and achieve the state-of-theart detection performance on the well-known FDDB face detection benchmark evaluation. In particular, we improve the state-of-the-art Faster RCNN framework by combining a number of strategies, including feature concatenation, hard negative mining, multi-scale training, model pre-training, and proper calibration of key parameters. As a consequence, the proposed scheme obtained the state-of-the-art face detection performance and was ranked as one of the best models in terms of ROC curves of the published methods on the FDDB benchmark.

AB Flood is a very destructive natural disaster in the world, which seriously threatens the safety of human life and property. In this paper, the most popular convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced to assess flood susceptibility in Shangyou County, China. The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows. First, the CNN technique is used for flood susceptibility mapping through two different CNN classification and feature extraction frameworks. Second, three data presentation methods are designed in the CNN architecture to fit the two proposed frameworks. To construct the proposed CNN-based methods, 13 flood triggering factors related to historical flood events in the study area were prepared. The performance of these CNN-based methods was evaluated using several objective criteria in comparison to the conventional support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Experiments results demonstrate that all the CNN-based methods can produce more reliable and practical flood susceptibility maps. For example, the proposed CNN-based classifiers were 0.022-0.054 higher than SVM in terms of area under the curve (AUC). In addition, in the classification process, CNN-based feature extraction can effectively improve the prediction capability of SVM by 0.021-0.051 in terms of AUC. Therefore, the proposed CNN frameworks can help mitigate and manage floods.

ID PROGNOSTIC VALUE; PET/CT; PREDICTOR; IPI
AB Total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV), calculated from F-18-FDG PET/CT baseline studies, is a prognostic factor in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) whose measurement requires the segmentation of all malignant foci throughout the body. No consensus currently exists regarding the most accurate approach for such segmentation. Further, all methods still require extensive manual input from an experienced reader. We examined whether an artificial intelligence-based method could estimate TMTV with a comparable prognostic value to TMTV measured by experts. Methods: Baseline F-18-FDG PET/CT scans of 301 DLBCL patients from the REMARC trial (NCT01122472) were retrospectively analyzed using a prototype software (PET Assisted Reporting System [PARS]). An automated whole-body high-uptake segmentation algorithm identified all 3-dimensional regions of interest (ROls) with increased tracer uptake. The resulting ROls were processed using a convolutional neural network trained on an independent cohort and classified as nonsuspicious or suspicious uptake. The PARS-based TMTV (TMTVPARS) was estimated as the sum of the volumes of ROls classified as suspicious uptake. The reference TMTV (TMTVREF) was measured by 2 experienced readers using independent semiautomatic software. The TMTVPARS was compared with the TMTVREF in terms of prognostic value for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: TMTVPARS was significantly correlated with the TMTVREF (p = 0.76; P < 0.001). Using PARS, an average of 24 regions per subject with increased tracer uptake was identified, and an average of 20 regions per subject was correctly identified as nonsuspicious or suspicious, yielding 85% classification accuracy, 80% sensitivity, and 88% specificity, compared with the TMTVREF region. Both TMTV results were predictive of PFS (hazard ratio, 2.3 and 2.6 for TMTVPARS and TMTVREF, respectively; P < 0.001) and OS (hazard ratio, 2.8 and 3.7 for TMTVPARS and TMTVREF, respectively; P < 0.001). Conclusion: TMTVPARS was consistent with that obtained by experts and displayed a significant prognostic value for PFS and OS in DLBCL patients. Classification of high-uptake regions using deep learning for rapidly discarding physiologic uptake may considerably simplify TMTV estimation, reduce observer variability, and facilitate the use of TMTV as a predictive factor in DLBCL patients.

AB Because many of the most important defects in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) occur at the size and timescales of the melt pool itself, the development of methodologies for monitoring the melt pool is critical. This works examines the possibility of in-situ detection of keyholing porosity and balling instabilities. Specifically, a visible-light high speed camera with a fixed field of view is used to study the morphology of L-PBF melt pools in the Inconel 718 material system. A scale-invariant description of melt pool morphology is constructed using Computer Vision techniques and unsupervised Machine Learning is used to differentiate between observed melt pools. By observing melt pools produced across process space, in-situ signatures are identified which may indicate flaws such as those observed ex-situ. This linkage of ex-situ and in-situ morphology enabled the use of supervised Machine Learning to classify melt pools observed (with the high speed camera) during fusion of non-bulk geometries such as overhangs.

AB Deep learning is currently the most successful machine learning technique in a wide range of application areas and has recently been applied successfully in drug discovery research to predict potential drug targets and to screen for active molecules. However, due to (1) the lack of large-scale studies, (2) the compound series bias that is characteristic of drug discovery datasets and (3) the hyperparameter selection bias that comes with the high number of potential deep learning architectures, it remains unclear whether deep learning can indeed outperform existing computational methods in drug discovery tasks. We therefore assessed the performance of several deep learning methods on a large-scale drug discovery dataset and compared the results with those of other machine learning and target prediction methods. To avoid potential biases from hyperparameter selection or compound series, we used a nested cluster-cross-validation strategy. We found (1) that deep learning methods significantly outperform all competing methods and (2) that the predictive performance of deep learning is in many cases comparable to that of tests performed in wet labs (i.e., in vitro assays).

AB The stringent requirements for low-latency and privacy of the emerging high-stake applications with intelligent devices such as drones and smart vehicles make the cloud computing inapplicable in these scenarios. Instead, edge machine learning becomes increasingly attractive for performing training and inference directly at network edges without sending data to a centralized data center. This stimulates a nascent field termed as federated learning for training a machine learning model on computation, storage, energy and bandwidth limited mobile devices in a distributed manner. To preserve data privacy and address the issues of unbalanced and non-IID data points across different devices, the federated averaging algorithm has been proposed for global model aggregation by computing the weighted average of locally updated model at each selected device. However, the limited communication bandwidth becomes the main bottleneck for aggregating the locally computed updates. We thus propose a novel over-the-air computation based approach for fast global model aggregation via exploring the superposition property of a wireless multiple-access channel. This is achieved by joint device selection and beamforming design, which is modeled as a sparse and low-rank optimization problem to support efficient algorithms design. To achieve this goal, we provide a difference-of-convex-functions (DC) representation for the sparse and low-rank function to enhance sparsity and accurately detect the fixed-rank constraint in the procedure of device selection. A DC algorithm is further developed to solve the resulting DC program with global convergence guarantees. The algorithmic advantages and admirable performance of the proposed methodologies are demonstrated through extensive numerical results.

ID PNEUMONIA
AB An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID-19) has been recorded in Wuhan, China since late December 2019, which subsequently became pandemic around the world. Although COVID-19 is an acutely treated disease, it can also be fatal with a risk of fatality of 4.03% in China and the highest of 13.04% in Algeria and 12.67% Italy (as of 8th April 2020). The onset of serious illness may result in death as a consequence of substantial alveolar damage and progressive respiratory failure. Although laboratory testing, e.g., using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the golden standard for clinical diagnosis, the tests may produce false negatives. Moreover, under the pandemic situation, shortage of RT-PCR testing resources may also delay the following clinical decision and treatment. Under such circumstances, chest CT imaging has become a valuable tool for both diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised deep learning strategy for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. The proposed method can minimise the requirements of manual labelling of CT images but still be able to obtain accurate infection detection and distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases. Based on the promising results obtained qualitatively and quantitatively, we can envisage a wide deployment of our developed technique in large-scale clinical studies.

DT Article

   learning; Disease classification
AB Deep learning is quickly becoming the standard technique for image classification. The main problem facing the automatic identification of plant diseases using this strategy is the lack of image databases capable of representing the wide variety of conditions and symptom characteristics found in practice. Data augmentation techniques decrease the impact of this problem, but those cannot reproduce most of the practical diversity. This paper explores the use of individual lesions and spots for the task, rather than considering the entire leaf. Since each region has its own characteristics, the variability of the data is increased without the need for additional images. This also allows the identification of multiple diseases affecting the same leaf. On the other hand, suitable symptom segmentation still needs to be done manually, preventing full automation. The accuracies obtained using this approach were, in average, 12% higher than those achieved using the original images. Additionally, no crop had accuracies below 75%, even when as many as 10 diseases were considered. Although the database does not cover the entire range of practical possibilities, these results indicate that, as long as enough data is available, deep learning techniques are effective for plant disease detection and recognition.

TI An in silico deep learning approach to multi-epitope vaccine design: a
   SARS-CoV-2 case study
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The rampant spread of COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, all over the world has led to over millions of deaths, and devastated the social, financial and political entities around the world. Without an existing effective medical therapy, vaccines are urgently needed to avoid the spread of this disease. In this study, we propose an in silico deep learning approach for prediction and design of a multi-epitope vaccine (DeepVacPred). By combining the in silico immunoinformatics and deep neural network strategies, the DeepVacPred computational framework directly predicts 26 potential vaccine subunits from the available SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence. We further use in silico methods to investigate the linear B-cell epitopes, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes, Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes in the 26 subunit candidates and identify the best 11 of them to construct a multi-epitope vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus. The human population coverage, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties and secondary structure of the designed vaccine are evaluated via state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, showing good quality of the designed vaccine. The 3D structure of the designed vaccine is predicted, refined and validated by in silico tools. Finally, we optimize and insert the codon sequence into a plasmid to ensure the cloning and expression efficiency. In conclusion, this proposed artificial intelligence (AI) based vaccine discovery framework accelerates the vaccine design process and constructs a 694aa multi-epitope vaccine containing 16 B-cell epitopes, 82 CTL epitopes and 89 HTL epitopes, which is promising to fight the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and can be further evaluated in clinical studies. Moreover, we trace the RNA mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and ensure that the designed vaccine can tackle the recent RNA mutations of the virus.

DE Myocardial infarction; Deep learning; Multi-lead ECG; Biomedical signal
AB Myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as heart attack, causes irreversible damage to heart muscles and even leads to death. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of MI is critical to avoid death. Blood tests and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are used to diagnose acute MI. However, for an increase in blood enzyme values, a certain time must pass after the attack. This time lag may delay MI diagnosis. Hence, ECG diagnosis is still very important. Manual ECG interpretation requires expertise and is prone to inter-observer variability. Therefore, computer aided diagnosis may be useful in automatic detection of MI on ECG. In this study, a deep learning model with an end-to-end structure on the standard 12-lead ECG signal for the diagnosis of MI is proposed. For this purpose, the most commonly used technique, convolutional neural network (CNN) is used. Our trained CNN model with the proposed architecture yielded impressive accuracy and sensitivity performance over 99.00% for MI diagnosis on all ECG lead signals. Thus, the proposed model has the potential to provide high performance on MI detection which can be used in wearable technologies and intensive care units. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mental health problems are inseparable from the environment. With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psychological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety (n = 192), schizophrenia (n = 44), substance-related disorders (n = 22) and eating disorders (n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treatment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if - with the user experience at the heart of design - the best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions. The capability of VR to simulate reality could greatly increase access to psychological therapies, while treatment outcomes could be enhanced by the technology's ability to create new realities. VR may merit the level of attention given to neuroimaging.

AB In this paper we propose a deep learning solution to age estimation from a single face image without the use of facial landmarks and introduce the IMDB-WIKI dataset, the largest public dataset of face images with age and gender labels. If the real age estimation research spans over decades, the study of apparent age estimation or the age as perceived by other humans from a face image is a recent endeavor. We tackle both tasks with our convolutional neural networks (CNNs) of VGG-16 architecture which are pre-trained on ImageNet for image classification. We pose the age estimation problem as a deep classification problem followed by a softmax expected value refinement. The key factors of our solution are: deep learned models from large data, robust face alignment, and expected value formulation for age regression. We validate our methods on standard benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results for both real and apparent age estimation.

ID INTRUSION DETECTION TECHNIQUES; ENVIRONMENT; SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION
AB With the emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and seamless Internet connectivity, the need to process streaming data on real-time basis has become essential. However, the existing data stream management systems are not efficient in analyzing the network log big data for real-time anomaly detection. Further, the existing anomaly detection approaches are not proficient because they cannot be applied to networks, are computationally complex, and suffer from high false positives. Thus, in this paper a hybrid data processing model for network anomaly detection is proposed that leverages grey wolf optimization (GWO) and convolutional neural network (CNN). To enhance the capabilities of the proposed model, GWO and CNN learning approaches were enhanced with: 1) improved exploration, exploitation, and initial population generation abilities and 2) revamped dropout functionality, respectively. These extended variants are referred to as Improved-GWO (ImGWO) and Improved-CNN (ImCNN). The proposed model works in two phases for efficient network anomaly detection. In the first phase, ImGWO is used for feature selection in order to obtain an optimal trade-off between two objectives, i.e., reduced error rate and feature-set minimization. In the second phase, ImCNN is used for network anomaly classification. The efficacy of the proposed model is validated on benchmark (DARPA'98 and KDD'99) and synthetic datasets. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed cloud-based anomaly detection model is superior in comparison to the other state-of-the-art models (used for network anomaly detection), in terms of accuracy, detection rate, false positive rate, and F-score. In average, the proposed model exhibits an overall improvement of 8.25%, 4.08%, and 3.62% in terms of detection rate, false positives, and accuracy, respectively; relative to standard GWO with CNN.

AB Domain adaptation has become a prominent problem setting in machine learning and related fields. This review asks the question: How can a classifier learn from a source domain and generalize to a target domain? We present a categorization of approaches, divided into, what we refer to as, sample-based, feature-based, and inference-based methods. Sample-based methods focus on weighting individual observations during training based on their importance to the target domain. Feature-based methods revolve around on mapping, projecting, and representing features such that a source classifier performs well on the target domain and inference-based methods incorporate adaptation into the parameter estimation procedure, for instance through constraints on the optimization procedure. Additionally, we review a number of conditions that allow for formulating bounds on the cross-domain generalization error. Our categorization highlights recurring ideas and raises questions important to further research.

AB Computer-aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) systems can enhance the diagnostic capabilities of physicians and reduce the time required for accurate diagnosis. The objective of this paper is to review the recent published segmentation and classification techniques and their state-of-the-art for the human brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). The review reveals the CAD systems of human brain MRI images are still an open problem. In the light of this review we proposed a hybrid intelligent machine learning technique for computer-aided detection system for automatic detection of brain tumor through magnetic resonance images. The proposed technique is based on the following computational methods; the feedback pulse-coupled neural network for image segmentation, the discrete wavelet transform for features extraction, the principal component analysis for reducing the dimensionality of the wavelet coefficients, and the feed forward back-propagation neural network to classify inputs into normal or abnormal. The experiments were carried out on 101 images consisting of 14 normal and 87 abnormal (malignant and benign tumors) from a real human brain MRI dataset. The classification accuracy on both training and test images is 99% which was significantly good. Moreover, the proposed technique demonstrates its effectiveness compared with the other machine learning recently published techniques. The results revealed that the proposed hybrid approach is accurate and fast and robust. Finally, possible future directions are suggested. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB For construction safety and health, continuous monitoring of unsafe conditions and action is essential in order to eliminate potential hazards in a timely manner. As a robust and automated means of field observation, computer vision techniques have been applied for the extraction of safety related information from site images and videos, and regarded as effective solutions complementary to current time-consuming and unreliable manual observational practices. Although some research efforts have been directed toward computer vision-based safety and health monitoring, its application in real practice remains premature due to a number of technical issues and research challenges in terms of reliability, accuracy, and applicability. This paper thus reviews previous attempts in construction applications from both technical and practical perspectives in order to understand the current status of computer vision techniques, which in turn suggests the direction of future research in the field of computer vision-based safety and health monitoring. Specifically, this paper categorizes previous studies into three groups-object detection, object tracking, and action recognition-based on types of information required to evaluate unsafe conditions and acts. The results demonstrate that major research challenges include comprehensive scene understanding, varying tracking accuracy by camera position, and action recognition of multiple equipment and workers. In addition, we identified several practical issues including a lack of task-specific and quantifiable metrics to evaluate the extracted information in safety context, technical obstacles due to dynamic conditions at construction sites and privacy issues. These challenges indicate a need for further research in these areas. Accordingly, this paper provides researchers insights into advancing knowledge and techniques for computer vision-based safety and health monitoring, and offers fresh opportunities and considerations to practitioners in understanding and adopting the techniques.

TI Generalized Seismic Phase Detection with Deep Learning
SO BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
ID EARTHQUAKE; CALIFORNIA; EVOLUTION
AB To optimally monitor earthquake-generating processes, seismologists have sought to lower detection sensitivities ever since instrumental seismic networks were started about a century ago. Recently, it has become possible to search continuous waveform archives for replicas of previously recorded events (i.e., template matching), which has led to at least an order of magnitude increase in the number of detected earthquakes and greatly sharpened our view of geological structures. Earthquake catalogs produced in this fashion, however, are heavily biased in that they are completely blind to events for which no templates are available, such as in previously quiet regions or for very large-magnitude events. Here, we show that with deep learning, we can overcome such biases without sacrificing detection sensitivity. We trained a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) on the vast hand-labeled data archives of the Southern California Seismic Network to detect seismic body-wave phases. We show that the ConvNet is extremely sensitive and robust in detecting phases even when masked by high background noise and when the ConvNet is applied to new data that are not represented in the training set (in particular, very large-magnitude events). This generalized phase detection framework will significantly improve earthquake monitoring and catalogs, which form the underlying basis for a wide range of basic and applied seismological research.

AB Question Answering (QA) systems based on Information Retrieval return precise answers to natural language questions, extracting relevant sentences from document collections. However, questions and sentences cannot be aligned terminologically, generating errors in the sentence retrieval. In order to augment the effectiveness in retrieving relevant sentences from documents, this paper proposes a hybrid Query Expansion (QE) approach, based on lexical resources and word embeddings, for QA systems. In detail, synonyms and hypernyms of relevant terms occurring in the question are first extracted from MultiWordNet and, then, contextualized to the document collection used in the QA system. Finally, the resulting set is ranked and filtered on the basis of wording and sense of the question, by employing a semantic similarity metric built on the top of a Word2Vec model. This latter is locally trained on an extended corpus pertaining the same topic of the documents used in the QA system. This QE approach is implemented into an existing QA system and experimentally evaluated, with respect to different possible configurations and selected baselines, for the Italian language and in the Cultural Heritage domain, assessing its effectiveness in retrieving sentences containing proper answers to questions belonging to four different categories.

AB Parkinson's disease (PD), a multi-system neurodegenerative disorder which affects the brain slowly, is characterized by symptoms such as muscle stiffness, tremor in the limbs and impaired balance, all of which tend to worsen with the passage of time. Available treatments target its symptoms, aiming to improve the quality of life. However, automatic diagnosis at early stages is still a challenging medicine-related task to date, since a patient may have an identical behavior to that of a healthy individual at the very early stage of the disease. Parkinson's disease detection through handwriting data is a significant classification problem for identification of PD at the infancy stage. In this paper, a PD identification is realized with help of handwriting images that help as one of the earliest indicators for PD. For this purpose, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network classifier with transfer learning and data augmentation techniques to improve the identification. Two approaches like freeze and fine-tuning of transfer learning are investigated using ImageNet and MNIST dataset as source task independently. A trained network achieved 98.28% accuracy using fine-tuning-based approach using ImageNet and PaHaW dataset. Experimental results on benchmark dataset reveal that the proposed approach provides better detection of Parkinson's disease as compared to state-of-the-art work.

AB Sensory neurons within skin form an interface between the external physical reality and the inner tactile perception. This interface enables sensory information to be organized identified, and interpreted through perceptual learningthe process whereby the sensing abilities improve through experience. Here, an artificial sensory neuron that can integrate and differentiate the spatiotemporal features of touched patterns for recognition is shown. The system comprises sensing, transmitting, and processing components that are parallel to those found in a sensory neuron. A resistive pressure sensor converts pressure stimuli into electric signals, which are transmitted to a synaptic transistor through interfacial ionic/electronic coupling via a soft ionic conductor. Furthermore, the recognition error rate can be dramatically decreased from 44% to 0.4% by integrating with the machine learning method. This work represents a step toward the design and use of neuromorphic electronic skin with artificial intelligence for robotics and prosthetics.

AB Even though convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are driving progress in medical image segmentation, standard models still have some drawbacks. First, the use of multi-scale approaches, i.e., encoder-decoder architectures, leads to a redundant use of information, where similar low-level features are extracted multiple times at multiple scales. Second, long-range feature dependencies are not efficiently modeled, resulting in non-optimal discriminative feature representations associated with each semantic class. In this paper we attempt to overcome these limitations with the proposed architecture, by capturing richer contextual dependencies based on the use of guided self-attention mechanisms. This approach is able to integrate local features with their corresponding global dependencies, as well as highlight interdependent channel maps in an adaptive manner. Further, the additional loss between different modules guides the attention mechanisms to neglect irrelevant information and focus on more discriminant regions of the image by emphasizing relevant feature associations. We evaluate the proposed model in the context of semantic segmentation on three different datasets: abdominal organs, cardiovascular structures and brain tumors. A series of ablation experiments support the importance of these attention modules in the proposed architecture. In addition, compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation networks our model yields better segmentation performance, increasing the accuracy of the predictions while reducing the standard deviation. This demonstrates the efficiency of our approach to generate precise and reliable automatic segmentations of medical images.

AB Objective. Signal classification is an important issue in brain computer interface (BCI) systems. Deep learning approaches have been used successfully in many recent studies to learn features and classify different types of data. However, the number of studies that employ these approaches on BCI applications is very limited. In this study we aim to use deep learning methods to improve classification performance of EEG motor imagery signals. Approach. In this study we investigate convolutional neural networks (CNN) and stacked autoencoders (SAE) to classify EEG Motor Imagery signals. A new form of input is introduced to combine time, frequency and location information extracted from EEG signal and it is used in CNN having one 1D convolutional and one max-pooling layers. We also proposed a new deep network by combining CNN and SAE. In this network, the features that are extracted in CNN are classified through the deep network SAE. Main results. The classification performance obtained by the proposed method on BCI competition IV dataset 2b in terms of kappa value is 0.547. Our approach yields 9% improvement over the winner algorithm of the competition. Significance. Our results show that deep learning methods provide better classification performance compared to other state of art approaches. These methods can be applied successfully to BCI systems where the amount of data is large due to daily recording.

AB Fine-grained visual recognition is an important problem in pattern recognition applications. However, it is a challenging task due to the subtle interclass difference and large intraclass variation. Recent visual attention models are able to automatically locate critical object parts and represent them against appearance variations. However, without consideration of spatial dependencies in discriminative feature learning, these methods are underperformed in classifying fine-grained objects. In this paper, we present a deep attention-based spatially recursive model that can learn to attend to critical object parts and encode them into spatially expressive representations. Our network is technically premised on bilinear pooling, enabling local pairwise feature interactions between outputs from two different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that correspond to distinct region detection and relevant feature extraction. Then, spatial long-short term memory (LSTMs) units are introduced to generate spatially meaningful hidden representations via the long-range dependency on all features in two dimensions. The attention model is leveraged between bilinear outcomes and spatial LSTMs for dynamic selection on varied inputs. Our model, which is composed of two-stream CNN layers, bilinear pooling, and spatial recursive encoding with attention, is end-to-end trainable to serve as the part detector and feature extractor whereby relevant features are localized, extracted, and encoded spatially for recognition purpose. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over two typical fine-grained recognition tasks: fine-grained image classification and person re-identification.

AB Soft sensor has been extensively utilized in industrial processes for prediction of key quality variables. To build an accurate virtual sensor model, it is very significant to model the dynamic and nonlinear behaviors of process sequential data properly. Recently, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network has shown great modeling ability on various time series, in which basic LSTM units can handle data nonlinearities and dynamics with a dynamic latent variable structure. However, the hidden variables in the basic LSTM unit mainly focus on describing the dynamics of input variables, which lack representation for the quality data. In this paper, a supervised LSTM (SLSTM) network is proposed to learn quality-relevant hidden dynamics for soft sensor application, which is composed of basic SLSTM unit at each sampling instant. In the basic SLSTM unit, the quality and input variables are simultaneously utilized to learn the dynamic hidden states, which are more relevant and useful for quality prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed SLSTM network is demonstrated on a penicillin fermentation process and an industrial debutanizer column.

AB Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a multi-discipline field that involves the automatic sensing of structural loads and response by means of a large number of sensors and instruments, followed by a diagnosis of the structural health based on the collected data. Because an SHM system implemented into a structure automatically senses, evaluates, and warns about structural conditions in real time, massive data are a significant feature of SHM. The techniques related to massive data are referred to as data science and engineering, and include acquisition techniques, transition techniques, management techniques, and processing and mining algorithms for massive data. This paper provides a brief review of the state of the art of data science and engineering in SHM as investigated by these authors, and covers the compressive sampling-based data-acquisition algorithm, the anomaly data diagnosis approach using a deep learning algorithm, crack identification approaches using computer vision techniques, and condition assessment approaches for bridges using machine learning algorithms. Future trends are discussed in the conclusion. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier LTD on behalf of Chinese Academy of Engineering and Higher Education Press Limited Company.

AB As a powerful tool, the vehicular network has been built to connect human communication and transportation around the world for many years to come. However, with the rapid growth of vehicles, the vehicular network becomes heterogeneous, dynamic, and large scaled, which makes it difficult to meet the strict requirements, such as ultralow latency, high reliability, high security, and massive connections of the next-generation (6G) network. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technique to make both the vehicle and wireless communication highly efficient and adaptable. Naturally, employing ML into vehicular communication and network becomes a hot topic and is being widely studied in both academia and industry, paving the way for the future intelligentization in 6G vehicular networks. In this article, we provide a survey on various ML techniques applied to communication, networking, and security parts in vehicular networks and envision the ways of enabling AI toward a future 6G vehicular network, including the evolution of intelligent radio (IR), network intelligentization, and self-learning with proactive exploration.

   FOCUSED ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CONTROL SETTINGS; GUIDED SEARCH
AB Researchers have long debated whether salient stimuli can involuntarily 'capture' visual attention. We review here evidence for a recently discovered inhibitory mechanism that may help to resolve this debate. This evidence suggests that salient stimuli naturally attempt to capture attention, but capture can be avoided if the salient stimulus is suppressed before it captures attention. Importantly, the suppression process can be more or less effective as a result of changing task demands or lapses in cognitive control. Converging evidence for the existence of this suppression mechanism comes from multiple sources, including psychophysics, eye-tracking, and event-related potentials (ERPs). We conclude that the evidence for suppression is strong, but future research will need to explore the nature and limits of this mechanism.

AB Importance Mammography screening currently relies on subjective human interpretation. Artificial intelligence (AI) advances could be used to increase mammography screening accuracy by reducing missed cancers and false positives. Objective To evaluate whether AI can overcome human mammography interpretation limitations with a rigorous, unbiased evaluation of machine learning algorithms. Design, Setting, and Participants In this diagnostic accuracy study conducted between September 2016 and November 2017, an international, crowdsourced challenge was hosted to foster AI algorithm development focused on interpreting screening mammography. More than 1100 participants comprising 126 teams from 44 countries participated. Analysis began November 18, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measurements Algorithms used images alone (challenge 1) or combined images, previous examinations (if available), and clinical and demographic risk factor data (challenge 2) and output a score that translated to cancer yes/no within 12 months. Algorithm accuracy for breast cancer detection was evaluated using area under the curve and algorithm specificity compared with radiologists' specificity with radiologists' sensitivity set at 85.9% (United States) and 83.9% (Sweden). An ensemble method aggregating top-performing AI algorithms and radiologists' recall assessment was developed and evaluated. Results Overall, 144 & x202f;231 screening mammograms from 85 & x202f;580 US women (952 cancer positive <= 12 months from screening) were used for algorithm training and validation. A second independent validation cohort included 166 & x202f;578 examinations from 68 & x202f;008 Swedish women (780 cancer positive). The top-performing algorithm achieved an area under the curve of 0.858 (United States) and 0.903 (Sweden) and 66.2% (United States) and 81.2% (Sweden) specificity at the radiologists' sensitivity, lower than community-practice radiologists' specificity of 90.5% (United States) and 98.5% (Sweden). Combining top-performing algorithms and US radiologist assessments resulted in a higher area under the curve of 0.942 and achieved a significantly improved specificity (92.0%) at the same sensitivity. Conclusions and Relevance While no single AI algorithm outperformed radiologists, an ensemble of AI algorithms combined with radiologist assessment in a single-reader screening environment improved overall accuracy. This study underscores the potential of using machine learning methods for enhancing mammography screening interpretation.
   Question How do deep learning algorithms perform compared with radiologists in screening mammography interpretation? Findings In this diagnostic accuracy study using 144 & x202f;231 screening mammograms from 85 & x202f;580 women from the United States and 166 & x202f;578 screening mammograms from 68 & x202f;008 women from Sweden, no single artificial intelligence algorithm outperformed US community radiologist benchmarks; including clinical data and prior mammograms did not improve artificial intelligence performance. However, combining best-performing artificial intelligence algorithms with single-radiologist assessment demonstrated increased specificity. Meaning Integrating artificial intelligence to mammography interpretation in single-radiologist settings could yield significant performance improvements, with the potential to reduce health care system expenditures and address resource scarcity experienced in population-based screening programs.
   This diagnostic accuracy study evaluates whether artificial intelligence can overcome human mammography interpretation limits with a rigorous, unbiased evaluation of machine learning algorithms.

DE Image classification; Semantic segmentation; Residual network
AB The community has been going deeper and deeper in designing one cutting edge network after another, yet some works are there suggesting that we may have gone too far in this dimension. Some researchers unravelled a residual network into an exponentially wider one, and assorted the success of residual networks to fusing a large amount of relatively shallow models. Since some of their early claims are still not settled, we in this paper dig more on this topic, i.e., the unravelled view of residual networks. Based on that, we try to find a good compromise between the depth and width. Afterwards, we walk through a typical pipeline of developing a deep-learning-based algorithm. We start from a group of relatively shallow networks, which perform as well or even better than the current (much deeper) state-of-the-art models on the ImageNet classification dataset. Then, we initialize fully convolutional networks (FCNs) using our pre-trained models, and tune them for semantic image segmentation. Results show that the proposed networks, as pre-trained features, can boost existing methods a lot. Even without exhausting the sophistical techniques to improve the classic FCN model, we achieve comparable results with the best performers on four widely-used datasets, i.e., Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, ADE20k and PASCAL-Context. The code and pre-trained models are released for public access. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE image completion; convolutional neural network
AB We present a novel approach for image completion that results in images that are both locally and globally consistent. With a fully-convolutional neural network, we can complete images of arbitrary resolutions by filling in missing regions of any shape. To train this image completion network to be consistent, we use global and local context discriminators that are trained to distinguish real images from completed ones. The global discriminator looks at the entire image to assess if it is coherent as a whole, while the local discriminator looks only at a small area centered at the completed region to ensure the local consistency of the generated patches. The image completion network is then trained to fool the both context discriminator networks, which requires it to generate images that are indistinguishable from real ones with regard to overall consistency as well as in details. We show that our approach can be used to complete a wide variety of scenes. Furthermore, in contrast with the patch-based approaches such as PatchMatch, our approach can generate fragments that do not appear elsewhere in the image, which allows us to naturally complete the images of objects with familiar and highly specific structures, such as faces.

AB The development of big data and Internet of things (IoT) have brought big changes to e-commerce. Different kinds of information sources have improved the consumers' online shopping performance and make it possible to realize the business intelligence. Grip force and eye-tracking sensors are applied to consumers' online reviews search behavior by relating them to the research approaches in IoT. To begin with, public cognition of human contact degrees of recycled water reuses with grip force test was measured. According to the human contact degrees, 9 recycled water reuses presented by the experiment are classified into 4 categories. Based on the conclusion drawn from grip force test, purified recycled water and fresh vegetable irrigated with recycled water are regarded as the drinking for high-level human contact degree and the irrigation of food crops for low-level human contact degree respectively. Several pictures are designed for eye-tracking test by simulating an on-line shopping web page on Taobao (the most popular online shopping platform in China). By comparing the fixation time participants spent on the areas of interest (AOIs), we justify that consumers' online reviews search behavior is substantially affected by human contact degrees of recycled products. It was found that consumers rely on safety perception reviews when buying high contact goods.

AB Corona virus disease (COVID-19) acknowledged as a pandemic by the WHO and mankind all over the world is vulnerable to this virus. Alternative tools are needed that can help in diagnosis of the coronavirus. Researchers of this article investigated the potential of machine learning methods for automatic diagnosis of corona virus with high accuracy from X-ray images. Two most commonly used classifiers were selected: logistic regression (LR) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The main reason was to make the system fast and efficient. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction approach was also investigated based on principal component analysis (PCA) to further speed up the learning process and improve the classification accuracy by selecting the highly discriminate features. The deep learning-based methods demand large amount of training samples compared to conventional approaches, yet adequate amount of labelled training samples was not available for COVID-19 X-ray images. Therefore, data augmentation technique using generative adversarial network (GAN) was employed to further increase the training samples and reduce the overfitting problem. We used the online available dataset and incorporated GAN to have 500 X-ray images in total for this study. Both CNN and LR showed encouraging results for COVID-19 patient identification. The LR and CNN models showed 95.2-97.6% overall accuracy without PCA and 97.6-100% with PCA for positive cases identification, respectively.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates billions of smart devices that can communicate with one another with minimal human intervention. IoT is one of the fastest developing fields in the history of computing, with an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020. However, the crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components involved in the deployment of such systems have introduced new security challenges. Implementing security measures, such as encryption, authentication, access control, network and application security for IoT devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. Therefore, existing security methods should be enhanced to effectively secure the IoT ecosystem. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has transitioned from laboratory novelty to practical machinery in several important applications. Consequently, ML/DL methods are important in transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML methods and recent advances in DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to each surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for IoT security and present the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings of each method. We discuss the opportunities and challenges involved in applying ML/DL to IoT security. These opportunities and challenges can serve as potential future research directions.

ID SALIENT OBJECT DETECTION
AB Representing features at multiple scales is of great importance for numerous vision tasks. Recent advances in backbone convolutional neural networks (CNNs) continually demonstrate stronger multi-scale representation ability, leading to consistent performance gains on a wide range of applications. However, most existing methods represent the multi-scale features in a layer-wise manner. In this paper, we propose a novel building block for CNNs, namely Res2Net, by constructing hierarchical residual-like connections within one single residual block. The Res2Net represents multi-scale features at a granular level and increases the range of receptive fields for each network layer. The proposed Res2Net block can be plugged into the state-of-the-art backbone CNN models, e.g., ResNet, ResNeXt, and DLA. We evaluate the Res2Net block on all these models and demonstrate consistent performance gains over baseline models on widely-used datasets, e.g., CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Further ablation studies and experimental results on representative computer vision tasks, i.e., object detection, class activation mapping, and salient object detection, further verify the superiority of the Res2Net over the state-of-the-art baseline methods.

AB Objective The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) has caused more than 26 million cases of Corona virus disease (COVID-19) in the world so far. To control the spread of the disease, screening large numbers of suspected cases for appropriate quarantine and treatment are a priority. Pathogenic laboratory testing is typically the gold standard, but it bears the burden of significant false negativity, adding to the urgent need of alternative diagnostic methods to combat the disease. Based on COVID-19 radiographic changes in CT images, this study hypothesized that artificial intelligence methods might be able to extract specific graphical features of COVID-19 and provide a clinical diagnosis ahead of the pathogenic test, thus saving critical time for disease control. Methods We collected 1065 CT images of pathogen-confirmed COVID-19 cases along with those previously diagnosed with typical viral pneumonia. We modified the inception transfer-learning model to establish the algorithm, followed by internal and external validation. Results The internal validation achieved a total accuracy of 89.5% with a specificity of 0.88 and sensitivity of 0.87. The external testing dataset showed a total accuracy of 79.3% with a specificity of 0.83 and sensitivity of 0.67. In addition, in 54 COVID-19 images, the first two nucleic acid test results were negative, and 46 were predicted as COVID-19 positive by the algorithm, with an accuracy of 85.2%. Conclusion These results demonstrate the proof-of-principle for using artificial intelligence to extract radiological features for timely and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.

AB Purpose: Although deep learning has shown great promise for MR image reconstruction, an open question regarding the success of this approach is the robustness in the case of deviations between training and test data. The goal of this study is to assess the influence of image contrast, SNR, and image content on the generalization of learned image reconstruction, and to demonstrate the potential for transfer learning.
   Methods: Reconstructions were trained from undersampled data using data sets with varying SNR, sampling pattern, image contrast, and synthetic data generated from a public image database. The performance of the trained reconstructions was evaluated on 10 in vivo patient knee MRI acquisitions from 2 different pulse sequences that were not used during training. Transfer learning was evaluated by fine-tuning baseline trainings from synthetic data with a small subset of in vivo MR training data.
   Results: Deviations in SNR between training and testing led to substantial decreases in reconstruction image quality, whereas image contrast was less relevant. Trainings from heterogeneous training data generalized well toward the test data with a range of acquisition parameters. Trainings from synthetic, non-MR image data showed residual aliasing artifacts, which could be removed by transfer learning-inspired finetuning.
   Conclusion: This study presents insights into the generalization ability of learned image reconstruction with respect to deviations in the acquisition settings between training and testing. It also provides an outlook for the potential of transfer learning to fine-tune trainings to a particular target application using only a small number of training cases.

AB Image-based machine learning and deep learning in particular has recently shown expert-level accuracy in medical image classification. In this study, we combine convolutional and recurrent architectures to train a deep network to predict colorectal cancer outcome based on images of tumour tissue samples. The novelty of our approach is that we directly predict patient outcome, without any intermediate tissue classification. We evaluate a set of digitized haematoxylin-eosin-stained tumour tissue microarray (TMA) samples from 420 colorectal cancer patients with clinicopathological and outcome data available. The results show that deep learning-based outcome prediction with only small tissue areas as input outperforms (hazard ratio 2.3; CI 95% 1.79-3.03; AUC 0.69) visual histological assessment performed by human experts on both TMA spot (HR 1.67; CI 95% 1.28-2.19; AUC 0.58) and whole-slide level (HR 1.65; CI 95% 1.30-2.15; AUC 0.57) in the stratification into low-and high-risk patients. Our results suggest that state-of-the-art deep learning techniques can extract more prognostic information from the tissue morphology of colorectal cancer than an experienced human observer.

AB Machine learning offers the potential for effective and efficient classification of remotely sensed imagery. The strengths of machine learning include the capacity to handle data of high dimensionality and to map classes with very complex characteristics. Nevertheless, implementing a machine-learning classification is not straightforward, and the literature provides conflicting advice regarding many key issues. This article therefore provides an overview of machine learning from an applied perspective. We focus on the relatively mature methods of support vector machines, single decision trees (DTs), Random Forests, boosted DTs, artificial neural networks, and k-nearest neighbours (k-NN). Issues considered include the choice of algorithm, training data requirements, user-defined parameter selection and optimization, feature space impacts and reduction, and computational costs. We illustrate these issues through applying machine-learning classification to two publically available remotely sensed data sets.

AB Nowadays, more and more images are available. However, to find a required image for an ordinary user is a challenging task. Large amount of researches on image retrieval have been carried out in the past two decades. Traditionally, research in this area focuses on content based image retrieval. However, recent research shows that there is a semantic gap between content based image retrieval and image semantics understandable by humans. As a result, research in this area has shifted to bridge the semantic gap between low level image features and high level semantics. The typical method of bridging the semantic gap is through the automatic image annotation (AIA) which extracts semantic features using machine learning techniques. In this paper, we focus on this latest development in image retrieval and provide a comprehensive survey on automatic image annotation. We analyse key aspects of the various AIA methods, including both feature extraction and semantic learning methods. Major methods are discussed and illustrated in details. We report our findings and provide future research directions in the AIA area in the conclusions (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Despite progress in perceptual tasks such as image classification, computers still perform poorly on cognitive tasks such as image description and question answering. Cognition is core to tasks that involve not just recognizing, but reasoning about our visual world. However, models used to tackle the rich content in images for cognitive tasks are still being trained using the same datasets designed for perceptual tasks. To achieve success at cognitive tasks, models need to understand the interactions and relationships between objects in an image. When asked "What vehicle is the person riding?", computers will need to identify the objects in an image as well as the relationships riding(man, carriage) and pulling(horse, carriage) to answer correctly that "the person is riding a horse-drawn carriage." In this paper, we present the Visual Genome dataset to enable the modeling of such relationships. We collect dense annotations of objects, attributes, and relationships within each image to learn these models. Specifically, our dataset contains over 108K images where each image has an average of objects, attributes, and pairwise relationships between objects. We canonicalize the objects, attributes, relationships, and noun phrases in region descriptions and questions answer pairs to WordNet synsets. Together, these annotations represent the densest and largest dataset of image descriptions, objects, attributes, relationships, and question answer pairs.

AB Current learning machines have successfully solved hard application problems, reaching high accuracy and displaying seemingly intelligent behavior. Here we apply recent techniques for explaining decisions of state-of-the-art learning machines and analyze various tasks from computer vision and arcade games. This showcases a spectrum of problem-solving behaviors ranging from naive and short-sighted, to well-informed and strategic. We observe that standard performance evaluation metrics can be oblivious to distinguishing these diverse problem solving behaviors. Furthermore, we propose our semi-automated Spectral Relevance Analysis that provides a practically effective way of characterizing and validating the behavior of nonlinear learning machines. This helps to assess whether a learned model indeed delivers reliably for the problem that it was conceived for. Furthermore, our work intends to add a voice of caution to the ongoing excitement about machine intelligence and pledges to evaluate and judge some of these recent successes in a more nuanced manner.

AB Nonlinear methods such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the gold standard for various challenging machine learning problems such as image recognition. Although these methods perform impressively well, they have a significant disadvantage, the lack of transparency, limiting the interpretability of the solution and thus the scope of application in practice. Especially DNNs act as black boxes due to their multilayer nonlinear structure. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for interpreting generic multilayer neural networks by decomposing the network classification decision into contributions of its input elements. Although our focus is on image classification, the method is applicable to a broad set of input data, learning tasks and network architectures. Our method called deep Taylor decomposition efficiently utilizes the structure of the network by backpropagating the explanations from the output to the input layer. We evaluate the proposed method empirically on the MNIST and ILSVRC data sets.

AB The splicing of pre-mRNAs into mature transcripts is remarkable for its precision, but the mechanisms by which the cellular machinery achieves such specificity are incompletely understood. Here, we describe a deep neural network that accurately predicts splice junctions from an arbitrary pre-mRNA transcript sequence, enabling precise prediction of noncoding genetic variants that cause cryptic splicing. Synonymous and intronic mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence validate at a high rate on RNA-seq and are strongly deleterious in the human population. De novo mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence are significantly enriched in patients with autism and intellectual disability compared to healthy controls and validate against RNA-seq in 21 out of 28 of these patients. We estimate that 9%-11% of pathogenic mutations in patients with rare genetic disorders are caused by this previously underappreciated class of disease variation.

TI Deep Learning-Based CSI Feedback Approach for Time-Varying Massive MIMO

DE Massive MIMO; FDD; CSI feedback; compressive sensing; deep learning
AB Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems rely on channel state information (CSI) feedback to perform precoding and achieve performance gain in frequency division duplex networks. However, the huge number of antennas poses a challenge to the conventional CSI feedback reduction methods and leads to excessive feedback overhead. In this letter, we develop a real-time CSI feedback architecture, called CsiNet-long short-term memory (LSTM), by extending a novel deep learning (DL)-based CSI sensing and recovery network. CsiNet-LSTM considerably enhances recovery quality and improves tradeoff between compression ratio (CR) and complexity by directly learning spatial structures combined with time correlation from training samples of time-varying massive MIMO channels. Simulation results demonstrate that CsiNet-LSTM outperforms existing compressive sensing-based and DL-based methods and is remarkably robust to CR reduction.

AB Machine learning has emerged as an invaluable tool in many research areas. In the present work, we harness this power to predict highly accurate molecular infrared spectra with unprecedented computational efficiency. To account for vibrational anharmonic and dynamical effects - typically neglected by conventional quantum chemistry approaches - we base our machine learning strategy on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. While these simulations are usually extremely time consuming even for small molecules, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the power of a variety of machine learning techniques, not only accelerating simulations by several orders of magnitude, but also greatly extending the size of systems that can be treated. To this end, we develop a molecular dipole moment model based on environment dependent neural network charges and combine it with the neural network potential approach of Behler and Parrinello. Contrary to the prevalent big data philosophy, we are able to obtain very accurate machine learning models for the prediction of infrared spectra based on only a few hundreds of electronic structure reference points. This is made possible through the use of molecular forces during neural network potential training and the introduction of a fully automated sampling scheme. We demonstrate the power of our machine learning approach by applying it to model the infrared spectra of a methanol molecule, n-alkanes containing up to 200 atoms and the protonated alanine tripeptide, which at the same time represents the first application of machine learning techniques to simulate the dynamics of a peptide. In all of these case studies we find an excellent agreement between the infrared spectra predicted via machine learning models and the respective theoretical and experimental spectra.

ID SPECTRAL-SPATIAL CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION
AB Recently, researchers have shown the powerful ability of deep methods with multilayers to extract high-level features and to obtain better performance for hyperspectral image classification. However, a common problem of traditional deep models is that the learned deep models might be suboptimal because of the limited number of training samples, especially for the image with large intraclass variance and low interclass variance. In this paper, novel convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multiscale convolution (MS-CNNs) are proposed to address this problem by extracting deep multiscale features from the hyperspectral image. Moreover, deep metrics usually accompany with MS-CNNs to improve the representational ability for the hyperspectral image. However, the usual metric learning would make the metric parameters in the learned model tend to behave similarly. This similarity leads to obvious model's redundancy and, thus, shows negative effects on the description ability of the deep metrics. Traditionally, determinantal point process (DPP) priors, which encourage the learned factors to repulse from one another, can be imposed over these factors to diversify them. Taking advantage of both the MS-CNNs and DPP-based diversity-promoting deep metrics, this paper develops a CNN with multiscale convolution and diversified metric to obtain discriminative features for hyperspectral image classification. Experiments are conducted over four real-world hyperspectral image data sets to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method. Experimental results show that our method is better than original deep models and can produce comparable or even better classification performance in different hyperspectral image data sets with respect to spectral and spectral-spatial features.

AB In recent years Deep Learning has brought about a breakthrough in Medical Image Segmentation. In this regard, U-Net has been the most popular architecture in the medical imaging community. Despite outstanding overall performance in segmenting multimodal medical images, through extensive experimentations on some challenging datasets, we demonstrate that the classical U-Net architecture seems to be lacking in certain aspects. Therefore, we propose some modifications to improve upon the already state-of-the-art U-Net model. Following these modifications, we develop a novel architecture, MultiResUNet, as the potential successor to the U-Net architecture. We have tested and compared MultiResUNet with the classical U-Net on a vast repertoire of multimodal medical images. Although only slight improvements in the cases of ideal images are noticed, remarkable gains in performance have been attained for the challenging ones. We have evaluated our model on five different datasets, each with their own unique challenges, and have obtained a relative improvement in performance of 10.15%, 5.07%, 2.63%, 1.41%, and 0.62% respectively. We have also discussed and highlighted some qualitatively superior aspects of MultiResUNet over classical U-Net that are not really reflected in the quantitative measures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Deep learning presents many opportunities for image-based plant phenotyping. Here we consider the capability of deep convolutional neural networks to perform the leaf counting task. Deep learning techniques typically require large and diverse datasets to learn generalizable models without providing a priori an engineered algorithm for performing the task. This requirement is challenging, however, for applications in the plant phenotyping field, where available datasets are often small and the costs associated with generating new data are high. In this work we propose a new method for augmenting plant phenotyping datasets using rendered images of synthetic plants. We demonstrate that the use of high-quality 3D synthetic plants to augment a dataset can improve performance on the leaf counting task. We also show that the ability of the model to generate an arbitrary distribution of phenotypes mitigates the problem of dataset shift when training and testing on different datasets. Finally, we show that real and synthetic plants are significantly interchangeable when training a neural network on the leaf counting task.

AB Ecological remote sensing is being transformed by three-dimensional (3D), multispectral measurements of forest canopies by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and computer vision structure from motion (SFM) algorithms. Yet applications of this technology have out-paced understanding of the relationship between collection method and data quality. Here, UAV-SFM remote sensing was used to produce 3D multispectral point clouds of Temperate Deciduous forests at different levels of UAV altitude, image overlap, weather, and image processing. Error in canopy height estimates was explained by the alignment of the canopy height model to the digital terrain model (R-2 = 0.81) due to differences in lighting and image overlap. Accounting for this, no significant differences were observed in height error at different levels of lighting, altitude, and side overlap. Overall, accurate estimates of canopy height compared to field measurements (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 3.6 m) and LIDAR (R-2 = 0.99, RMSE = 3.0 m) were obtained under optimal conditions of clear lighting and high image overlap (>80%). Variation in point cloud quality appeared related to the behavior of SFM image features'. Future research should consider the role of image features as the fundamental unit of SFM remote sensing, akin to the pixel of optical imaging and the laser pulse of LIDAR.

AB In this letter, a novel autonomous control framework "Grid Mind" is proposed for the secure operation of power grids based on cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The proposed platform provides a data-driven, model-free and closed-loop control agent trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms by interacting with massive simulations and/or real environment of a power grid. The proposed agent learns from scratch to master the power grid voltage control problem purely from data. It can make autonomous voltage control (AVC) strategies to support grid operators in making effective and timely control actions, according to the current system conditions detected by real-time measurements from supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) or phasor measurement units (PMUs). Two state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely deep Q-network (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), are proposed to formulate the AVC problem with performance compared. Case studies on a realistic 200-bus test system demonstrate the effectiveness and promising performance of the proposed framework.

AB Deep-learning framework has significantly impelled the development of modern machine learning technology by continuously pushing the limit of traditional recognition and processing of images, speech, and videos. In the meantime, it starts to penetrate other disciplines, such as biology, genetics, materials science, and physics. Here, we report a deep-learning-based model, comprising two bidirectional neural networks assembled by a partial stacking strategy, to automatically design and optimize three-dimensional chiral metamaterials with strong chiroptical responses at predesignated wavelengths. The model can help to discover the intricate, nonintuitive relationship between a metamaterial structure and its optical responses from a number of training examples, which circumvents the time-consuming, case-by-case numerical simulations in conventional metamaterial designs. This approach not only realizes the forward prediction of optical performance much more accurately and efficiently but also enables one to inversely retrieve designs from given requirements. Our results demonstrate that such a data-driven model can be applied as a very powerful tool in studying complicated light-matter interactions and accelerating the on-demand design of nanophotonic devices, systems, and architectures for real world applications.

AB Accurate runoff forecasting plays an important role in guaranteeing the sustainable utilization and management of water resources. Artificial intelligence methods can provide new possibilities for runoff prediction when the underlying physical relationship cannot be explicitly obtained. However, few reports evaluate the performances of various artificial intelligence methods in forecasting daily streamflow time series for sustainable water resources management by far. To refill this research gap, the potentials of five artificial intelligence methods in daily streamflow series prediction are examined, including artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neural based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), extreme learning machine (ELM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM). Four quantitative statistical indexes are chosen as the evaluation benchmarks. The results from two huge hydropower reservoirs in China show that five artificial intelligence methods can achieve satisfying forecasting results, while the SVM, GPR and ELM methods can produce better performances than ANN and ANFIS in both training and testing phases with respective to four indexes. Thus, it is of great importance to carefully choose the appropriate forecasting models based on the actual characteristics of the studied reservoir.

AB Science and technology are driving people's life changes, including education and the environment. Many scholars have attempted to import technology into the classroom to help students learn in different subjects. However, students often need assistance with unfamiliar learning approaches and learning environments. This study proposed a non-immersive virtual reality (VR) guidance system combined with a two-tier strategy to help students learn geology knowledge. Two groups of students used different learning approaches: the experimental group students were guided by the two-tier test VR guidance system, and the control group students learned with the conventional VR guidance system. According to the experimental result, the two-tier test VR guidance system not only improved the students' learning achievement in natural science, but also enhanced their learning motivation. In addition, according to the sequential results, we found that VR learning materials or environmental resources can help students answer questions and solve problems more effectively.

AB Recently, the research field of salient object detection is undergoing a rapid and remarkable development along with the wide usage of deep neural networks. Being trained with a large number of images annotated with strong pixel-level ground-truth masks, the deep salient object detectors have achieved the state-of-the-art performance. However, it is expensive and time-consuming to provide the pixel-level ground-truth masks for each training image. To address this problem, this paper proposes one of the earliest frameworks to learn deep salient object detectors without requiring any human annotation. The supervisory signals used in our learning framework are generated through a novel supervision synthesis scheme, in which the key insights are "knowledge source transition" and "supervision by fusion". Specifically, in the proposed learning framework, both the external knowledge source and the internal knowledge source are explored dynamically to provide informative cues for synthesizing supervision required in our approach, while a two-stream fusion mechanism is also established to implement the supervision synthesis process. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the deep salient object detector trained by our newly proposed learning framework often works well without requiring any human annotated masks, which even approaches to its upper-bound obtained under the fully supervised learning fashion (within only 3 percent performance gap). Besides, we also apply the salient object detector learnt with our annotation-free learning framework to assist the weakly supervised semantic segmentation task, which demonstrates that our approach can also alleviate the heavy supplementary supervision required in the existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework.

AB Salient object detection from RGB-D images aims to utilize both the depth view and RGB view to automatically localize objects of human interest in the scene. Although a few earlier efforts have been devoted to the study of this paper in recent years, two major challenges still remain: 1) how to leverage the depth view effectively to model the depth-induced saliency and 2) how to implement an optimal combination of the RGB view and depth view, which can make full use of complementary information among them. To address these two challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which transfers the structure of the RGB-based deep neural network to be applicable for depth view and fuses the deep representations of both views automatically to obtain the final saliency map. In the proposed framework, the first challenge is modeled as a cross-view transfer problem and addressed by using the task-relevant initialization and adding deep supervision in hidden layer. The second challenge is addressed by a multiview CNN fusion model through a combination layer connecting the representation layers of RGB view and depth view. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the significant and consistent improvements of the proposed approach over other state-of-the-art methods.

ID P-PHASE; AUTOMATIC PICKING
AB As the number of seismic sensors grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult for analysts to pick seismic phases manually and comprehensively, yet such efforts are fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Despite years of improvements in automatic phase picking, it is difficult to match the performance of experienced analysts. A more subtle issue is that different seismic analysts may pick phases differently, which can introduce bias into earthquake locations. We present a deep-neural-network-based arrival-time picking method called "PhaseNet" that picks the arrival times of both P and S waves. Deep neural networks have recently made rapid progress in feature learning, and with sufficient training, have achieved super-human performance in many applications. PhaseNet uses three-component seismic waveforms as input and generates probability distributions of P arrivals, S arrivals and noise as output. We engineer PhaseNet such that peaks in the probability distributions provide accurate arrival times for both P and S waves. PhaseNet is trained on the prodigious available data set provided by analyst-labelled P and S arrival times from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. The data set we use contains more than 700 000 waveform samples extracted from over 30 yr of earthquake recordings. We demonstrate that PhaseNet achieves much higher picking accuracy and recall rate than existing methods when applied to the waveforms of known earthquakes, which has the potential to increase the number of S-wave observations dramatically over what is currently available. This will enable both improved locations and improved shear wave velocity models.

AB In this paper, we propose a context-aware local binary feature learning (CA-LBFL) method for face recognition. Unlike existing learning-based local face descriptors such as discriminant face descriptor (DFD) and compact binary face descriptor (CBFD) which learn each feature code individually, our CA-LBFL exploits the contextual information of adjacent bits by constraining the number of shifts from different binary bits, so that more robust information can be exploited for face representation. Given a face image, we first extract pixel difference vectors (PDV) in local patches, and learn a discriminative mapping in an unsupervised manner to project each pixel difference vector into a context-aware binary vector. Then, we perform clustering on the learned binary codes to construct a codebook, and extract a histogram feature for each face image with the learned codebook as the final representation. In order to exploit local information from different scales, we propose a context-aware local binary multi-scale feature learning (CA-LBMFL) method to jointly learn multiple projection matrices for face representation. To make the proposed methods applicable for heterogeneous face recognition, we present a coupled CA-LBFL (C-CA-LBFL) method and a coupled CA-LBMFL (C-CA-LBMFL) method to reduce the modality gap of corresponding heterogeneous faces in the feature level, respectively. Extensive experimental results on four widely used face datasets clearly show that our methods outperform most state-of-the-art face descriptors.

TI Intelligent Offloading in Multi-Access Edge Computing: A
   State-of-the-Art Review and Framework
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA English
DT Review
AB Multi-access edge computing (MEC), which is deployed in the proximity area of the mobile user side as a supplement to the traditional remote cloud center, has been regarded as a promising technique for 5G heterogeneous networks. With the assistance of MEC, mobile users can access computing resource effectively. Also, congestion in the core network can be alleviated by offloading. To adapt in stochastic and constantly varying environments, augmented intelligence (AI) is introduced in MEC for intelligent decision making. For this reason, several recent works have focused on intelligent offloading in MEC to harvest its potential benefits. Therefore, machine learning (ML)-based approaches, including reinforcement learning, supervised/unsupervised learning, deep learning, as well as deep reinforcement learning for AI in MEC have become hot topics. However, many technical challenges still remain to be addressed for AI in MEC. In this article, the basic concept of MEC and main applications are introduced, and existing fundamental works using various ML-based approaches are reviewed. Furthermore, some potential issues of AI in MEC for future work are discussed.

AB While the dominant research stream on tourism technologies has investigated the adoption of self-service, mobile, and web-based technologies, the potential of destination marketing through virtual technologies is yet to be fully investigated. Because of limited empirical knowledge about the application of virtual reality (VR) in tourism, this research investigates how VR can be used to deliver integrated tourist experiences prior to their stay at the hotel. Through a lab-coordinated experiment, the current study contrasts three hotel previews that differ in their level of interactivity (images vs. 360 tour vs. VR). The findings demonstrate that a VR preview induces higher elaboration of mental imagery about the experience and a stronger sense of presence compared to both the 360 preview and images preview, thereby translating into enhanced brand experience. Such findings suggest that VR is substantial in prompting tourists to "daydream" about lodging offers prior to experiencing them at the destination's premises.

AB Background: Medical practitioners use survival models to explore and understand the relationships between patients' covariates (e.g. clinical and genetic features) and the effectiveness of various treatment options. Standard survival models like the linear Cox proportional hazards model require extensive feature engineering or prior medical knowledge to model treatment interaction at an individual level. While nonlinear survival methods, such as neural networks and survival forests, can inherently model these high-level interaction terms, they have yet to be shown as effective treatment recommender systems.
   Methods: We introduce DeepSurv, a Cox proportional hazards deep neural network and state-of-the-art survival method for modeling interactions between a patient's covariates and treatment effectiveness in order to provide personalized treatment recommendations.
   Results: We perform a number of experiments training DeepSurv on simulated and real survival data. We demonstrate that DeepSurv performs as well as or better than other state-of-the-art survival models and validate that DeepSurv successfully models increasingly complex relationships between a patient's covariates and their risk of failure. We then show how DeepSurv models the relationship between a patient's features and effectiveness of different treatment options to show how DeepSurv can be used to provide individual treatment recommendations. Finally, we train DeepSurv on real clinical studies to demonstrate how it's personalized treatment recommendations would increase the survival time of a set of patients.
   Conclusions: The predictive and modeling capabilities of DeepSurv will enable medical researchers to use deep neural networks as a tool in their exploration, understanding, and prediction of the effects of a patient's characteristics on their risk of failure.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI)-the ability of a machine to perform cognitive tasks to achieve a particular goal based on provided data-is revolutionizing and reshaping our health-care systems. The current availability of ever-increasing computational power, highly developed pattern recognition algorithms and advanced image processing software working at very high speeds has led to the emergence of computer-based systems that are trained to perform complex tasks in bioinformatics, medical imaging and medical robotics. Accessibility to 'big data' enables the 'cognitive' computer to scan billions of bits of unstructured information, extract the relevant information and recognize complex patterns with increasing confidence. Computer-based decision-support systems based on machine learning (ML) have the potential to revolutionize medicine by performing complex tasks that are currently assigned to specialists to improve diagnostic accuracy, increase efficiency of throughputs, improve clinical workflow, decrease human resource costs and improve treatment choices. These characteristics could be especially helpful in the management of prostate cancer, with growing applications in diagnostic imaging, surgical interventions, skills training and assessment, digital pathology and genomics. Medicine must adapt to this changing world, and urologists, oncologists, radiologists and pathologists, as high-volume users of imaging and pathology, need to understand this burgeoning science and acknowledge that the development of highly accurate AI-based decision-support applications of ML will require collaboration between data scientists, computer researchers and engineers.

AB Predicting water table depth over the long-term in agricultural areas presents great challenges because these areas have complex and heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics, boundary conditions, and human activities; also, nonlinear interactions occur among these factors. Therefore, a new time series model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was developed in this study as an alternative to computationally expensive physical models. The proposed model is composed of an LSTM layer with another fully connected layer on top of it, with a dropout method applied in the first LSTM layer. In this study, the proposed model was applied and evaluated in five sub-areas of Hetao Irrigation District in arid northwestern China using data of 14 years (2000-2013). The proposed model uses monthly water diversion, evaporation, precipitation, temperature, and time as input data to predict water table depth. A simple but effective standardization method was employed to pre-process data to ensure data on the same scale. 14 years of data are separated into two sets: training set (2000-2011) and validation set (2012-2013) in the experiment. As expected, the proposed model achieves higher R-2 scores (0.789-0.952) in water table depth prediction, when compared with the results of traditional feed-forward neural network (FFNN), which only reaches relatively low R-2 scores (0.004-0.495), proving that the proposed model can preserve and learn previous information well. Furthermore, the validity of the dropout method and the proposed model's architecture are discussed. Through experimentation, the results show that the dropout method can prevent overfitting significantly. In addition, comparisons between the R-2 scores of the proposed model and Double-LSTM model (R-2 scores range from 0.170 to 0.864), further prove that the proposed model's architecture is reasonable and can contribute to a strong learning ability on time series data. Thus, one can conclude that the proposed model can serve as an alternative approach predicting water table depth, especially in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain.

AB This paper aims to accelerate the test-time computation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially very deep CNNs[1] that have substantially impacted the computer vision community. Unlike previous methods that are designed for approximating linear filters or linear responses, our method takes the nonlinear units into account. We develop an effective solution to the resulting nonlinear optimization problem without the need of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). More importantly, while previous methods mainly focus on optimizing one or two layers, our nonlinear method enables an asymmetric reconstruction that reduces the rapidly accumulated error when multiple (e.g., >= 10) layers are approximated. For the widely used very deep VGG-16 model[1], our method achieves a whole-model speedup of 4x with merely a 0.3 percent increase of top-5 error in ImageNet classification. Our 4x accelerated VGG-16 model also shows a graceful accuracy degradation for object detection when plugged into the Fast R-CNN detector[2].

AB One of the significant tasks in data-driven fault diagnosis methods is to configure a good feature set involving statistical parameters. However, statistical parameters are often incapable of representing the dynamic behavior of planetary gearboxes under variable operating conditions. Although the use of deep learning algorithms to find a good set of features for fault diagnosis has somewhat improved diagnostic performance, the lack of domain knowledge incorporated into deep learning algorithms has limited further improvement. Accordingly, this paper developed a variant of deep residual networks (DRNs), the so-called deep residual networks with dynamically weighted wavelet coefficients (DRN+DWWC) to improve diagnostic performance, which takes a series of sets of wavelet packet coefficients on various frequency bands as an input. Further, the fact that no general consensus has been reached as to which frequency band contains the most intrinsic information about a planetary gearbox's health status calls for "dynamic weighting layers" in the DRN+DWWC and the role of the layers is to dynamically adjust a weight applied to each set of wavelet packet coefficients to find a discriminative set of features that will be further used for planetary gearbox fault diagnosis.

AB Inspired by recent development of artificial satellite, remote sensing images have attracted extensive attention. Recently, notable progress has been made in scene classification and target detection. However, it is still not clear how to describe the remote sensing image content with accurate and concise sentences. In this paper, we investigate to describe the remote sensing images with accurate and flexible sentences. First, some annotated instructions are presented to better describe the remote sensing images considering the special characteristics of remote sensing images. Second, in order to exhaustively exploit the contents of remote sensing images, a large-scale aerial image data set is constructed for remote sensing image caption. Finally, a comprehensive review is presented on the proposed data set to fully advance the task of remote sensing caption. Extensive experiments on the proposed data set demonstrate that the content of the remote sensing image can be completely described by generating language descriptions. The data set is available at https://github.com/201528014227051/RSICD_optimal.

AB There is a growing demand for detailed and accurate landslide maps and inventories around the globe, but particularly in hazard-prone regions such as the Himalayas. Most standard mapping methods require expert knowledge, supervision and fieldwork. In this study, we use optical data from the Rapid Eye satellite and topographic factors to analyze the potential of machine learning methods, i.e., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF), and different deep-learning convolution neural networks (CNNs) for landslide detection. We use two training zones and one test zone to independently evaluate the performance of different methods in the highly landslide-prone Rasuwa district in Nepal. Twenty different maps are created using ANN, SVM and RF and different CNN instantiations and are compared against the results of extensive fieldwork through a mean intersection-over-union (mIOU) and other common metrics. This accuracy assessment yields the best result of 78.26% mIOU for a small window size CNN, which uses spectral information only. The additional information from a 5 m digital elevation model helps to discriminate between human settlements and landslides but does not improve the overall classification accuracy. CNNs do not automatically outperform ANN, SVM and RF, although this is sometimes claimed. Rather, the performance of CNNs strongly depends on their design, i.e., layer depth, input window sizes and training strategies. Here, we conclude that the CNN method is still in its infancy as most researchers will either use predefined parameters in solutions like Google TensorFlow or will apply different settings in a trial-and-error manner. Nevertheless, deep-learning can improve landslide mapping in the future if the effects of the different designs are better understood, enough training samples exist, and the effects of augmentation strategies to artificially increase the number of existing samples are better understood.

AB The recent concept of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) can significantly improve the capacity of the communication network, and it has been regarded as a promising technology for the next-generation wireless communications. However, the fundamental challenge of existing massive MIMO systems is that high computational complexity and complicated spatial structures bring great difficulties to exploit the characteristics of the channel and sparsity of these multi-antennas systems. To address this problem, in this paper, we focus on channel estimation and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation, and a novel framework that integrates the massive MIMO into deep learning is proposed. To realize end-to-end performance, a deep neural network (DNN) is employed to conduct offline learning and online learning procedures, which is effective to learn the statistics of the wireless channel and the spatial structures in the angle domain. Concretely, the DNN is first trained by simulated data in different channel conditions with the aids of the offline learning, and then corresponding output data can be obtained based on current input data during online learning process. In order to realize super-resolution channel estimation and DOA estimation, two algorithms based on the deep learning are developed, in which the DOA can be estimated in the angle domain without additional complexity directly. Furthermore, simulation results corroborate that the proposed deep learning based scheme can achieve better performance in terms of the DOA estimation and the channel estimation compared with conventional methods, and the proposed scheme is well investigated by extensive simulation in various cases for testing its robustness.

AB Intelligent data-driven fault diagnosis methods for rolling element bearings have been widely developed in the recent years. In real industries, the collected machinery signals are usually exposed to environmental noises, and the bearing operating condition changes in different working scenarios. That leads to distribution discrepancy between the labeled training data and the unlabeled testing data, and consequently the diagnosis performance deteriorates. This paper proposes a novel deep distance metric learning method for rolling bearing fault diagnosis based on deep learning. A deep convolutional neural network is used as the main architecture. Based on the learned representations through multiple hidden layers, a representation clustering algorithm is proposed to minimize the distance of intra-class variations and maximize the distance of inter-class variations simultaneously. A domain adaptation method is adopted to minimize the maximum mean discrepancy between training and testing data. In this way, the robustness of the fault diagnosis method can be significantly improved against noise and variation of working condition. Extensive experiments on a popular rolling bearing dataset are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the diagnosis performance is widely evaluated in different scenarios. Comparisons with other approaches and the related works on the same dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The experimental results of this study suggest the proposed deep distance metric learning method offers a new and promising tool for intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearings.

AB Recently, due to the rapid development and remarkable result of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) approaches in various domains for several long-standing artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, there has an extreme interest in applying toward network security too. Nowadays, in the information communication technology (ICT) era, the intrusion detection (ID) system has the great potential to be the frontier of security against cyberattacks and plays a vital role in achieving network infrastructure and resources. Conventional ID systems are not strong enough to detect advanced malicious threats. Heterogeneity is one of the important features of big data. Thus, designing an efficient ID system using a heterogeneous dataset is a massive research problem. There are several ID datasets openly existing for more research by the cybersecurity researcher community. However, no existing research has shown a detailed performance evaluation of several ML methods on various publicly available ID datasets. Due to the dynamic nature of malicious attacks with continuously changing attack detection methods, ID datasets are available publicly and are updated systematically. In this research, spark MLlib (machine learning library)-based robust classical ML classifiers for anomaly detection and state of the art DL, such as the convolutional-auto encoder (Conv-AE) for misuse attack, is used to develop an efficient and intelligent ID system to detect and classify unpredictable malicious attacks. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed ID system, we have used several important performance metrics, such as FAR, DR, and accuracy, while experiments are conducted on the publicly existing dataset, specifically the contemporary heterogeneous CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset.

AB Along with potential benefits to healthcare delivery, machine learning healthcare applications (ML-HCAs) raise a number of ethical concerns. Ethical evaluations of ML-HCAs will need to structure the overall problem of evaluating these technologies, especially for a diverse group of stakeholders. This paper outlines a systematic approach to identifying ML-HCA ethical concerns, starting with a conceptual model of the pipeline of the conception, development, implementation of ML-HCAs, and the parallel pipeline of evaluation and oversight tasks at each stage. Over this model, we layer key questions that raise value-based issues, along with ethical considerations identified in large part by a literature review, but also identifying some ethical considerations that have yet to receive attention. This pipeline model framework will be useful for systematic ethical appraisals of ML-HCA from development through implementation, and for interdisciplinary collaboration of diverse stakeholders that will be required to understand and subsequently manage the ethical implications of ML-HCAs.

AB This letter proposed a road extraction method based on fully convolutional networks (FCNs) with an ensemble strategy in order to solve the imbalance of road and background areas in aerial images. By utilizing the FCN, we consider road extraction as a semantic segmentation problem. In the network, the weight of the loss function is modified because of the imbalance between the roads and backgrounds, and there will be a larger punishment if roads are wrongly classified as background. Since it is difficult to determine an appropriate weight of the loss function for a given image, an ensemble method based on spatial consistency (SC) is proposed. The result maps that are obtained from the FCNs with different loss functions are fused in our proposed ensemble strategy, which also avoids the determination of weights. Our method is tested using the Massachusetts road data set, and it was proven to be effective compared with the base fully convolutional model according to our experimental result.

AB This brief is concerned with the distributed maneuvering of multiple autonomous surface vehicles guided by a virtual leader moving along a parameterized path. In the guidance loop, a distributed guidance law is developed by incorporating a constant bearing strategy into a path-maneuvering design such that a prescribed formation pattern can be reached. To optimize the guidance signal under velocity constraint as well as minimize control torque during transient phase, an optimization-based command governor is employed to generate an optimal guidance signal for vehicle kinetics. The optimization problem is formulated as a bound-constrained quadratic programming problem, which is solved using a recurrent neural network. In the control loop, an estimator is developed where a fuzzy system is used to approximate unknown kinetics based on input and output data. Next, a kinetic control law is constructed based on the optimal command signal and the fuzzy-system-based estimator. By virtue of cascade stability analysis, it is proven that distributed maneuvering errors converge to a residual set. The simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB Drought forecasting with a long lead time is essential for early warning systems and risk management strategies. The use of machine learning algorithms has been proven to be beneficial in forecasting droughts. However, forecasting at long lead times remains a challenge due to the effects of climate change and the complexities involved in drought assessment. The rise of deep learning techniques can solve this issue, and the present work aims to use a stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture to forecast a commonly used drought measure, namely, the Standard Precipitation Evaporation Index. The model was then applied to the New South Wales region of Australia, with hydrometeorological and climatic variables as predictors. The multivariate interpolated grid of the Climatic Research Unit was used to compute the index at monthly scales, with meteorological variables as predictors. The architecture was trained using data from the period of 1901-2000 and tested on data from the period of 2001-2018. The results were then forecasted at lead times ranging from 1 month to 12 months. The forecasted results were analysed in terms of drought characteristics, such as drought intensity, drought onset, spatial extent and number of drought months, to elucidate how these characteristics improve the understanding of drought forecasting. The drought intensity forecasting capability of the model used two statistical metrics, namely, the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error. The variation in the number of drought months was examined using the threat score technique. The results of this study showed that the stacked LSTM model can forecast effectively at short-term and long-term lead times. Such findings will be essential for government agencies and can be further tested to understand the forecasting capability of the presented architecture at shorter temporal scales, which can range from days to weeks.

ID FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; PLANETARY GEARBOX; MAINTENANCE; KERNEL
AB The feasibility of monitoring the health of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes based on the lubricant pressure data in the supervisory control and data acquisition system is investigated in this paper. A deep neural network (DNN)-based framework is developed to monitor conditions of WT gearboxes and identify their impending failures. Six data-mining algorithms, the k-nearest neighbors, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, ridge regression (Ridge), support vector machines, shallow neural network, as well as DNN, are applied to model the lubricant pressure. A comparative analysis of developed data-driven models is conducted and the DNN model is the most accurate. To prevent the overfitting of the DNN model, a dropout algorithm is applied into the DNN training process. Computational results show that the prediction error will shift before the occurrences of gearbox failures. An exponentially weighted moving average control chart is deployed to derive criteria for detecting the shifts. The effectiveness of the proposed monitoring approach is demonstrated by examining real cases from wind farms in China and bench-marked against the gearbox monitoring based on the oil temperature data.

AB The ongoing COVID-19 corona virus outbreak has caused a global disaster with its deadly spreading. Due to the absence of effective remedial agents and the shortage of immunizations against the virus, population vulnerability increases. In the current situation, as there are no vaccines available; therefore, social distancing is thought to be an adequate precaution (norm) against the spread of the pandemic virus. The risks of virus spread can be minimized by avoiding physical contact among people. The purpose of this work is, therefore, to provide a deep learning platform for social distance tracking using an overhead perspective. The framework uses the YOLOv3 object recognition paradigm to identify humans in video sequences. The transfer learning methodology is also implemented to increase the accuracy of the model. In this way, the detection algorithm uses a pre-trained algorithm that is connected to an extra trained layer using an overhead human data set. The detection model identifies peoples using detected bounding box information. Using the Euclidean distance, the detected bounding box centroid's pairwise distances of people are determined. To estimate social distance violations between people, we used an approximation of physical distance to pixel and set a threshold. A violation threshold is established to evaluate whether or not the distance value breaches the minimum social distance threshold. In addition, a tracking algorithm is used to detect individuals in video sequences such that the person who violates/ crosses the social distance threshold is also being tracked. Experiments are carried out on different video sequences to test the efficiency of the model. Findings indicate that the developed framework successfully distinguishes individuals who walk too near and breaches/violates social distances; also, the transfer learning approach boosts the overall efficiency of the model.

AB Stroke is a common, serious, and disabling global health-care problem, and rehabilitation is a major part of patient care. There is evidence to support rehabilitation in well coordinated multidisciplinary stroke units or through provision of early supported provision of discharge teams. Potentially beneficial treatment options for motor recovery of the arm include constraint-induced movement therapy and robotics. Promising interventions that could be beneficial to improve aspects of gait include fitness training, high-intensity therapy, and repetitive-task training. Repetitive-task training might also improve transfer functions. Occupational therapy can improve activities of daily living; however, information about the clinical effect of various strategies of cognitive rehabilitation and strategies for aphasia and dysarthria is scarce. Several large trials of rehabilitation practice and of novel therapies (eg, stem-cell therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, virtual reality, robotic therapies, and drug augmentation) are underway to inform future practice.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to fruit detection using deep convolutional neural networks. The aim is to build an accurate, fast and reliable fruit detection system, which is a vital element of an autonomous agricultural robotic platform; it is a key element for fruit yield estimation and automated harvesting. Recent work in deep neural networks has led to the development of a state-of-the-art object detector termed Faster Region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN). We adapt this model, through transfer learning, for the task of fruit detection using imagery obtained from two modalities: colour (RGB) and Near-Infrared (NIR). Early and late fusion methods are explored for combining the multi-modal (RGB and NIR) information. This leads to a novel multi-modal Faster R-CNN model, which achieves state-of-the-art results compared to prior work with the Fl score, which takes into account both precision and recall performances improving from 0.807 to 0.838 for the detection of sweet pepper. In addition to improved accuracy, this approach is also much quicker to deploy for new fruits, as it requires bounding box annotation rather than pixel-level annotation (annotating bounding boxes is approximately an order of magnitude quicker to perform). The model is retrained to perform the detection of seven fruits, with the entire process taking four hours to annotate and train the new model per fruit.

AB Reinforcement learning offers to robotics a framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors. Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.

AB In this paper, we designed an end-to-end spectralspatial residual network (SSRN) that takes raw 3-D cubes as input data without feature engineering for hyperspectral image classification. In this network, the spectral and spatial residual blocks consecutively learn discriminative features from abundant spectral signatures and spatial contexts in hyperspectral imagery (HSI). The proposed SSRN is a supervised deep learning framework that alleviates the declining-accuracy phenomenon of other deep learning models. Specifically, the residual blocks connect every other 3-D convolutional layer through identity mapping, which facilitates the backpropagation of gradients. Furthermore, we impose batch normalization on every convolutional layer to regularize the learning process and improve the classification performance of trained models. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the SSRN achieved the state-of-the-art HSI classification accuracy in agricultural, rural-urban, and urban data sets: Indian Pines, Kennedy Space Center, and University of Pavia.

   learning; Computer vision; Segmentation networks; Industry 4; 0
AB Automated surface-anomaly detection using machine learning has become an interesting and promising area of research, with a very high and direct impact on the application domain of visual inspection. Deep-learning methods have become the most suitable approaches for this task. They allow the inspection system to learn to detect the surface anomaly by simply showing it a number of exemplar images. This paper presents a segmentation-based deep-learning architecture that is designed for the detection and segmentation of surface anomalies and is demonstrated on a specific domain of surface-crack detection. The design of the architecture enables the model to be trained using a small number of samples, which is an important requirement for practical applications. The proposed model is compared with the related deep-learning methods, including the state-of-the-art commercial software, showing that the proposed approach outperforms the related methods on the specific domain of surface-crack detection. The large number of experiments also shed light on the required precision of the annotation, the number of required training samples and on the required computational cost. Experiments are performed on a newly created dataset based on a real-world quality control case and demonstrates that the proposed approach is able to learn on a small number of defected surfaces, using only approximately 25-30 defective training samples, instead of hundreds or thousands, which is usually the case in deep-learning applications. This makes the deep-learning method practical for use in industry where the number of available defective samples is limited. The dataset is also made publicly available to encourage the development and evaluation of new methods for surface-defect detection.

LA English
DT Article
DE Compressed sensing; MRI; GAN; DiscoGAN; CycleGAN
ID SEPARATION
AB Compressed sensing magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) has provided theoretical foundations upon which the time-consuming MRI acquisition process can be accelerated. However, it primarily relies on iterative numerical solvers, which still hinders their adaptation in time-critical applications. In addition, recent advances in deep neural networks have shown their potential in computer vision and image processing, but their adaptation to MRI reconstruction is still in an early stage. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based generative adversarial model, RefineGAN, for fast and accurate CS-MRI reconstruction. The proposed model is a variant of fully-residual convolutional autoencoder and generative adversarial networks (GANs), specifically designed for CS-MRI formulation; it employs deeper generator and discriminator networks with cyclic data consistency loss for faithful interpolation in the given under-sampled k-space data. In addition, our solution leveragesa chained network to further enhance the reconstruction quality. RefineGAN is fast and accurate-the reconstruction process is extremely rapid, as low as tens of milliseconds for reconstruction of a 256 x 256 image, because it is one-way deployment on a feed-forward network, and the image quality is superior even for extremely low sampling rate (as low as 10%) due to the data-driven nature of the method. We demonstrate that RefineGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art CS-MRI methods by a large margin in terms of both running time and image quality via evaluation using several open-source MRI databases.

AB BackgroundFollowing visible successes on a wide range of predictive tasks, machine learning techniques are attracting substantial interest from medical researchers and clinicians. We address the need for capacity development in this area by providing a conceptual introduction to machine learning alongside a practical guide to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms using freely-available open source software and public domain data.MethodsWe demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques by developing three predictive models for cancer diagnosis using descriptions of nuclei sampled from breast masses. These algorithms include regularized General Linear Model regression (GLMs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a radial basis function kernel, and single-layer Artificial Neural Networks. The publicly-available dataset describing the breast mass samples (N=683) was randomly split into evaluation (n=456) and validation (n=227) samples.We trained algorithms on data from the evaluation sample before they were used to predict the diagnostic outcome in the validation dataset. We compared the predictions made on the validation datasets with the real-world diagnostic decisions to calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the three models. We explored the use of averaging and voting ensembles to improve predictive performance. We provide a step-by-step guide to developing algorithms using the open-source R statistical programming environment.ResultsThe trained algorithms were able to classify cell nuclei with high accuracy (.94 -.96), sensitivity (.97 -.99), and specificity (.85 -.94). Maximum accuracy (.96) and area under the curve (.97) was achieved using the SVM algorithm. Prediction performance increased marginally (accuracy =.97, sensitivity =.99, specificity =.95) when algorithms were arranged into a voting ensemble.ConclusionsWe use a straightforward example to demonstrate the theory and practice of machine learning for clinicians and medical researchers. The principals which we demonstrate here can be readily applied to other complex tasks including natural language processing and image recognition.

DT Article
ID STEREO; VISION
AB 125 years after Bertha Benz completed the first overland journey in automotive history, the Mercedes Benz S-Class S 500 INTELLIGENT DRIVE followed the same route from Mannheim to Pforzheim, Germany, in fully autonomous manner. The autonomous vehicle was equipped with close-to-production sensor hardware and relied solely on vision and radar sensors in combination with accurate digital maps to obtain a comprehensive understanding of complex traffic situations. The historic Bertha Benz Memorial Route is particularly challenging for autonomous driving. The course taken by the autonomous vehicle had a length of 103 km and covered rural roads, 23 small villages and major cities (e.g. downtown Mannheim and Heidelberg). The route posed a large variety of difficult traffic scenarios including intersections with and without traffic lights, roundabouts, and narrow passages with oncoming traffic. This paper gives an overview of the autonomous vehicle and presents details on vision and radar-based perception, digital road maps and video-based self-localization, as well as motion planning in complex urban scenarios.

AB This paper considers a last-mile delivery system in which a delivery truck operates in coordination with a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones). Deploying UAVs from the truck enables customers located further from the depot to receive drone-based deliveries. The problem is first formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP). However, owing to the computational complexity of this problem, only trivially-sized problems may be solved directly via the MILP. Thus, a heuristic solution approach that consists of solving a sequence of three subproblems is proposed. Extensive numerical testing demonstrates that this approach effectively solves problems of practical size within reasonable runtimes. Additional analysis quantifies the potential time savings associated with employing multiple UAVs. The analysis also reveals that additional UAVs may have diminishing marginal returns. An analysis of five different endurance models demonstrates the effects of these models on UAV assignments. The model and heuristic also support anticipated future systems that feature automation for UAV launch and retrieval.

AB The combination of machine learning and numerical methods has recently become popular in the prediction of macroscopic and microscopic hydrodynamics parameters of bubble column reactors. Such numerical combination can develop a smart multiphase bubble column reactor with the ability of low-cost computational time when considering the big data. However, the accuracy of such models should be improved by optimizing the data parameters. This paper uses an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to train four big data inputs with a novel integration of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of gas. The results show that the increasing number of input variables improves the intelligence of the ANFIS method up to , and the number of rules during the learning process has a significant effect on the accuracy of this type of modeling. Furthermore, the proper selection of model's parameters results in higher accuracy in the prediction of the flow characteristics in the column structure.

AB Global economic and social life has been severely challenged since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 disease a pandemic. Travel, tourism and hospitality, in particular, has been massively impacted by the lockdowns used to maintain social distance to manage the disease. Robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-robot interactions have gained an increased presence to help manage the spread of COVID-19 in hospitals, airports, transportation systems, recreation and scenic areas, hotels, restaurants, and communities in general. Humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, and other intelligent robots are used in many different ways to reduce human contact and the potential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including delivering materials, disinfecting and sterilizing public spaces, detecting or measuring body temperature, providing safety or security, and comforting and entertaining patients. While controversial in the past due to concerns over job losses and data privacy, the adoption of robotics and artificial intelligence in travel and tourism will likely continue after the COVID-19 pandemic becomes less serious. Tourism scholars should seize this opportunity to develop robotic applications that enhance tourist experiences, the protection of natural and cultural resources, citizen participation in tourism development decision making, and the emergence of new 'high-touch' employment opportunities for travel, tourism and hospitality workers.

AB Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been proved to be able to produce artificial data that are alike the real data, and have been successfully applied to various image generation tasks as a useful tool for data augmentation. In this paper, we develop an auxiliary classifier GAN(ACGAN)-based framework to learn from mechanical sensor signals and generate realistic one-dimensional raw data. The proposed architecture contains two parts, generator and discriminator, and both of them are built by stacking one-dimensional convolution layers to learn local features from the original input. Such stacked structure is able to learn hierarchical representations through convolution operation and easy to train. Batch normalization is performed within generator to avoid the problem of gradient vanishing during training, and category labels are used as the auxiliary information in this framework to help train the model. The proposed approach is designed to produce realistic synthesized signals with labels and the generated signals can be used as augmented data for further applications in machine fault diagnosis. In order to evaluate the performance of the generative model, we introduce a set of assessment to evaluate the quality of generated samples, including statistical characteristics and experimental verification. Finally, induction motor vibration signal datasets are utilized to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We present a model that generates natural language descriptions of images and their regions. Our approach leverages datasets of images and their sentence descriptions to learn about the inter-modal correspondences between language and visual data. Our alignment model is based on a novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over image regions, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the two modalities through a multimodal embedding. We then describe a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architecture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate novel descriptions of image regions. We demonstrate that our alignment model produces state of the art results in retrieval experiments on Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO datasets. We then show that the generated descriptions outperform retrieval baselines on both full images and on a new dataset of region-level annotations. Finally, we conduct large-scale analysis of our RNN language model on the Visual Genome dataset of 4.1 million captions and highlight the differences between image and region-level caption statistics.

AB The excitation and vibration triggered by the long-term operation of railway vehicles inevitably result in defective states of catenary support devices. With the massive construction of high-speed electrified railways, automatic defect detection of diverse and plentiful fasteners on the catenary support device is of great significance for operation safety and cost reduction. Nowadays, the catenary support devices are periodically captured by the cameras mounted on the inspection vehicles during the night, but the inspection still mostly relies on human visual interpretation. To reduce the human involvement, this paper proposes a novel vision-based method that applies the deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in the defect detection of the fasteners. Our system cascades three DCNN-based detection stages in a coarse-to-fine manner, including two detectors to sequentially localize the cantilever joints and their fasteners and a classifier to diagnose the fasteners' defects. Extensive experiments and comparisons of the defect detection of catenary support devices along the Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railway line indicate that the system can achieve a high detection rate with good adaptation and robustness in complex environments.

AB Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VFib) are the life-threatening shockable arrhythmias which require immediate attention. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation are highly recommended means of immediate treatment of these shockable arrhythmias and to resume spontaneous circulation. However, to increase efficacy of defibrillation by an automated external defibrillator (AED), an accurate distinction of shockable ventricular arrhythmias from non-shockable ones needs to be provided upfront. Therefore, in this work, we have proposed a novel tool for an automated differentiation of shockable and non-shockable ventricular arrhythmias from 2 s electrocardiogram (ECG) segments. Segmented ECGs are processed by an eleven-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Our proposed system was 10-fold cross validated and achieved maximum accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 93.18%, 95.32% and 91.04% respectively. Its high performance indicates that shockable life-threatening arrhythmia can be immediately detected and thus increase the chance of survival while CPR or AED-based support is performed. Our tool can also be seamlessly integrated with an ECG acquisition systems in the intensive care units (ICUs). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge of pore-water pressure (PWP) variation is fundamental for slope stability. A precise prediction of PWP is difficult due to complex physical mechanisms and in situ natural variability. To explore the applicability and advantages of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on PWP prediction, three variants of RNNs, i.e., standard RNN, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are adopted and compared with a traditional static artificial neural network (ANN), i.e., multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Measurements of rainfall and PWP of representative piezometers from a fully instrumented natural slope in Hong Kong are used to establish the prediction models. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) are used for model evaluations. The influence of input time series length on the model performance is investigated. The results reveal that MLP can provide acceptable performance but is not robust. The uncertainty bounds of RMSE of the MLP model range from 0.24 kPa to 1.12 kPa for the selected two piezometers. The standard RNN can perform better but the robustness is slightly affected when there are significant time lags between PWP changes and rainfall. The GRU and LSTM models can provide more precise and robust predictions than the standard RNN. The effects of the hidden layer structure and the dropout technique are investigated. The single-layer GRU is accurate enough for PWP prediction, whereas a double-layer GRU brings extra time cost with little accuracy improvement. The dropout technique is essential to overfitting prevention and improvement of accuracy.

AB Transfer learning aims at improving the performance of target learners on target domains by transferring the knowledge contained in different but related source domains. In this way, the dependence on a large number of target-domain data can be reduced for constructing target learners. Due to the wide application prospects, transfer learning has become a popular and promising area in machine learning. Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning research studies, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey article reviews more than 40 representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different data sets, that is, Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31, and the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.

AB Urban land use information is essential for a variety of urban-related applications such as urban planning and regional administration. The extraction of urban land use from very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) remotely sensed imagery has, therefore, drawn much attention in the remote sensing community. Nevertheless, classifying urban land use from VFSR images remains a challenging task, due to the extreme difficulties in differentiating complex spatial patterns to derive high-level semantic labels. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer great potential to extract high-level spatial features, thanks to its hierarchical nature with multiple levels of abstraction. However, blurred object boundaries and geometric distortion, as well as huge computational redundancy, severely restrict the potential application of CNN for the classification of urban land use. In this paper, a novel object-based convolutional neural network (OCNN) is proposed for urban land use classification using VFSR images. Rather than Pixel-wise convolutional processes, the OCNN relies on segmented objects as its functional units, and CNN networks are used to analyse and label objects such as to partition within-object and between-object variation. Two CNN networks with different model structures and window sizes are developed to predict linearly shaped objects (e.g. Highway, Canal) and general (other non-linearly shaped) objects. Then a rule-based decision fusion is performed to integrate the class-specific classification results. The effectiveness of the proposed OCNN method was tested on aerial photography of two large urban scenes in Southampton and Manchester in Great Britain. The OCNN combined with large and small window sizes achieved excellent classification accuracy and computational efficiency, consistently outperforming its sub-modules, as well as other benchmark comparators, including the Pixel-wise CNN, contextual-based MRF and object-based OBIA-SVM methods. The proposed method provides the first object-based CNN framework to effectively and efficiently address the complicated problem of urban land use classification from VFSR images.

AB Multisensor fusion is of great importance in Earth observation related applications. For instance, hyperspectral images (HSIs) provide wealthy spectral information while light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data provide elevation information, and using HSI and LiDAR data together can achieve better classification performance. In this paper, an unsupervised feature extraction framework, named as patch-to-patch convolutional neural network (PToP CNN), is proposed for collaborative classification of hyperspectral and LiDAR data. More specific, a three-tower PToP mapping is first developed to seek an accurate representation from HSI to LiDAR data, aiming at merging multiscale features between two different sources. Then, by integrating hidden layers of the designed PToP CNN, extracted features are expected to possess deeply fused characteristics. Accordingly, features from different hidden layers are concatenated into a stacked vector and fed into three fully connected layers. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed classification framework, experiments are executed on two benchmark remote sensing data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method provides superior performance when compared with some state-of-the-art classifiers, such as two-branch CNN and context CNN.

AB Deep learning is rapidly advancing many areas of science and technology with multiple success stories in image, text, voice and video recognition, robotics, and autonomous driving. In this paper we demonstrate how deep neural networks (DNN) trained on large transcriptional response data sets can classify various drugs to therapeutic categories solely based on their transcriptional profiles. We used the perturbation samples of 678 drugs across A549, MCF-7, and PC-3 cell lines from the LINCS Project and linked those to 12 therapeutic use categories derived from MeSH. To train the DNN, we utilized both gene level transcriptomic data and transcriptomic data processed using a pathway activation scoring algorithm, for a pooled data set of samples perturbed with different concentrations of the drug for 6 and 24 hours. In both pathway and gene level classification, DNN achieved high classification accuracy and convincingly outperformed the support vector machine (SVM) model on every multiclass classification problem, however, models based on pathway level data performed significantly better. For the first time we demonstrate a deep learning neural net trained on transcriptomic data to recognize pharmacological properties of multiple drugs across different biological systems and conditions. We also propose using deep neural net confusion matrices for drug repositioning. This work is a proof of principle for applying deep learning to drug discovery and development.

AB In recent years, mobile devices are equipped with increasingly advanced sensing and computing capabilities. Coupled with advancements in Deep Learning (DL), this opens up countless possibilities for meaningful applications, e.g., for medical purposes and in vehicular networks. Traditional cloud-based Machine Learning (ML) approaches require the data to be centralized in a cloud server or data center. However, this results in critical issues related to unacceptable latency and communication inefficiency. To this end, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been proposed to bring intelligence closer to the edge, where data is produced. However, conventional enabling technologies for ML at mobile edge networks still require personal data to be shared with external parties, e.g., edge servers. Recently, in light of increasingly stringent data privacy legislations and growing privacy concerns, the concept of Federated Learning (FL) has been introduced. In FL, end devices use their local data to train an ML model required by the server. The end devices then send the model updates rather than raw data to the server for aggregation. FL can serve as an enabling technology in mobile edge networks since it enables the collaborative training of an ML model and also enables DL for mobile edge network optimization. However, in a large-scale and complex mobile edge network, heterogeneous devices with varying constraints are involved. This raises challenges of communication costs, resource allocation, and privacy and security in the implementation of FL at scale. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the background and fundamentals of FL. Then, we highlight the aforementioned challenges of FL implementation and review existing solutions. Furthermore, we present the applications of FL for mobile edge network optimization. Finally, we discuss the important challenges and future research directions in FL.

AB Visual inspection of histopathology slides is one of the main methods used by pathologists to assess the stage, type and subtype of lung tumors. Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are the most prevalent subtypes of lung cancer, and their distinction requires visual inspection by an experienced pathologist. In this study, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (inception v3) on whole-slide images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas to accurately and automatically classify them into LUAD, LUSC or normal lung tissue. The performance of our method is comparable to that of pathologists, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97. Our model was validated on independent datasets of frozen tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies. Furthermore, we trained the network to predict the ten most commonly mutated genes in LUAD. We found that six of them-STK11, EGFR, FAT1, SETBP1, KRAS and TP53-can be predicted from pathology images, with AUCs from 0.733 to 0.856 as measured on a held-out population. These findings suggest that deep-learning models can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype or gene mutations. Our approach can be applied to any cancer type, and the code is available at https://github.com/ncoudray/DeepPATH.

AB Imaging through scattering is an important yet challenging problem. Tremendous progress has been made by exploiting the deterministic input-output "transmission matrix" for a fixed medium. However, this "one-to-one" mapping is highly susceptible to speckle decorrelations - small perturbations to the scattering medium lead to model errors and severe degradation of the imaging performance. Our goal here is to develop a new framework that is highly scalable to both medium perturbations and measurement requirement. To do so, we propose a statistical "one-to-all" deep learning (DL) technique that encapsulates a wide range of statistical variations for the model to be resilient to speckle decorrelations. Specifically, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is able to learn the statistical information contained in the speckle intensity patterns captured on a set of diffusers having the same macroscopic parameter. We then show for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that the trained CNN is able to generalize and make high-quality object predictions through an entirely different set of diffusers of the same class. Our work paves the way to a highly scalable DL approach for imaging through scattering media. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB Beyond sample curation and basic pathologic characterization, the digitized H&E-stained images of TCGA samples remain underutilized. To highlight this resource, we present mappings of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) based on H&E images from 13 TCGA tumor types. These TIL maps are derived through computational staining using a convolutional neural network trained to classify patches of images. Affinity propagation revealed local spatial structure in TIL patterns and correlation with overall survival. TIL map structural patterns were grouped using standard histopathological parameters. These patterns are enriched in particular T cell subpopulations derived from molecular measures. TIL densities and spatial structure were differentially enriched among tumor types, immune subtypes, and tumor molecular subtypes, implying that spatial infiltrate state could reflect particular tumor cell aberration states. Obtaining spatial lymphocytic patterns linked to the rich genomic characterization of TCGA samples demonstrates one use for the TCGA image archives with insights into the tumor-immune microenvironment.

AB We present a privacy-preserving deep learning system in which many learning participants perform neural network-based deep learning over a combined dataset of all, without revealing the participants' local data to a central server. To that end, we revisit the previous work by Shokri and Shmatikov (ACM CCS 2015) and show that, with their method, local data information may be leaked to an honest-but-curious server. We then fix that problem by building an enhanced system with the following properties: 1) no information is leaked to the server and 2) accuracy is kept intact, compared with that of the ordinary deep learning system also over the combined dataset. Our system bridges deep learning and cryptography: we utilize asynchronous stochastic gradient descent as applied to neural networks, in combination with additively homomorphic encryption. We show that our usage of encryption adds tolerable overhead to the ordinary deep learning system.

ID STREAKS REMOVAL; DECOMPOSITION
AB We introduce a deep network architecture called DerainNet for removing rain streaks from an image. Based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN), we directly learn the mapping relationship between rainy and clean image detail layers from data. Because we do not possess the ground truth corresponding to real-world rainy images, we synthesize images with rain for training. In contrast to other common strategies that increase depth or breadth of the network, we use image processing domain knowledge to modify the objective function and improve deraining with a modestly sized CNN. Specifically, we train our DerainNet on the detail (high-pass) layer rather than in the image domain. Though DerainNet is trained on synthetic data, we find that the learned network translates very effectively to real-world images for testing. Moreover, we augment the CNN framework with image enhancement to improve the visual results. Compared with the state-of-the-art single image de-raining methods, our method has improved rain removal and much faster computation time after network training.

AB In this paper, we investigate the classical detection problem for vehicle networks with multiple antennas, by considering practical communication scenarios, where the interfering signals are correlated over time or frequency. In such cases, the conventional detector requires to estimate the joint distribution of the interfering signals, which imposes a huge computational complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose the joint use of a maximum likelihood detector (MLD) and a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), where MLD is used to produce an initial detection result and DCNN improves the detection by exploiting the local correlation to suppress the interference. Furthermore, the improved DCNN is enhanced by devising the loss function through the cross-entropy of the detection, which can help to suppress the interfering signals and simultaneously force the residual interference to approach the Gaussian distribution. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed detector compared to the conventional one. The trained model and source code for this work are available at https://github.com/skypitcher/project_dcnnmld.

AB Pavement crack detection is a critical task for insuring road safety. Manual crack detection is extremely time-consuming. Therefore, an automatic road crack detection method is required to boost this progress. However, it remains a challenging task due to the intensity inhomogeneity of cracks and complexity of the background, e.g., the low contrast with surrounding pavements and possible shadows with a similar intensity. Inspired by recent advances of deep learning in computer vision, we propose a novel network architecture, named feature pyramid and hierarchical boosting network (FPHBN), for pavement crack detection. The proposed network integrates context information to low-level features for crack detection in a feature pyramid way, and it balances the contributions of both easy and hard samples to loss by nested sample reweighting in a hierarchical way during training. In addition, we propose a novel measurement for crack detection named average intersection over union (AIU). To demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of the proposed method, we evaluate it on five crack datasets and compare it with the state-of-the-art crack detection, edge detection, and semantic segmentation methods. The extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms these methods in terms of accuracy and generalizability. Code and data can be found in https://github.com/fyangneil/pavement-crack-detection.

AB It has been a long-held belief that judicious resource allocation is critical to mitigating interference, improving network efficiency, and ultimately optimizing wireless communication performance. The traditional wisdom is to explicitly formulate resource allocation as an optimization problem and then exploit mathematical programming to solve the problem to a certain level of optimality. Nonetheless, as wireless networks become increasingly diverse and complex, for example, in the high-mobility vehicular networks, the current design methodologies face significant challenges and thus call for rethinking of the traditional design philosophy. Meanwhile, deep learning, with many success stories in various disciplines, represents a promising alternative due to its remarkable power to leverage data for problem solving. In this article, we discuss the key motivations and roadblocks of using deep learning for wireless resource allocation with application to vehicular networks. We review major recent studies that mobilize the deep-learning philosophy in wireless resource allocation and achieve impressive results. We first discuss deep-learning-assisted optimization for resource allocation. We then highlight the deep reinforcement learning approach to address resource allocation problems that are difficult to handle in the traditional optimization framework. We also identify some research directions that deserve further investigation.

AB Machine learning addresses the question of how to build computers that improve automatically through experience. It is one of today's most rapidly growing technical fields, lying at the intersection of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence and data science. Recent progress in machine learning has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms and theory and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of online data and low-cost computation. The adoption of data-intensive machine-learning methods can be found throughout science, technology and commerce, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including health care, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, policing, and marketing.

AB Artificial intelligence (Al) is an extensive scientific discipline which enables computer systems to solve problems by emulating complex biological processes such as learning, reasoning and self-correction. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of Al techniques for improving performance of optical communication systems and networks. The use of Al-based techniques is first studied in applications related to optical transmission, ranging from the characterization and operation of network components to performance monitoring, mitigation of nonlinearities, and quality of transmission estimation. Then, applications related to optical network control and management are also reviewed, including topics like optical network planning and operation in both transport and access networks. Finally, the paper also presents a summary of opportunities and challenges in optical networking where Al is expected to play a key role in the near future. (C) 2018 The Authors.

DE Intelligent fault diagnosis; mechanical big data; softmax regression;
   sparse filtering; unsupervised feature learning
ID CLASSIFICATION; CHALLENGES
AB Intelligent fault diagnosis is a promising tool to deal with mechanical big data due to its ability in rapidly and efficiently processing collected signals and providing accurate diagnosis results. In traditional intelligent diagnosis methods, however, the features are manually extracted depending on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise. Such processes take advantage of human ingenuity but are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Inspired by the idea of unsupervised feature learning that uses artificial intelligence techniques to learn features from raw data, a two-stage learning method is proposed for intelligent diagnosis of machines. In the first learning stage of the method, sparse filtering, an unsupervised two-layer neural network, is used to directly learn features from mechanical vibration signals. In the second stage, softmax regression is employed to classify the health conditions based on the learned features. The proposed method is validated by a motor bearing dataset and a locomotive bearing dataset, respectively. The results show that the proposed method obtains fairly high diagnosis accuracies and is superior to the existing methods for the motor bearing dataset. Because of learning features adaptively, the proposed method reduces the need of human labor and makes intelligent fault diagnosis handle big data more easily.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) will transform business practices and industries and has the potential to address major societal problems, including sustainability. Degradation of the natural environment and the climate crisis are exceedingly complex phenomena requiring the most advanced and innovative solutions. Aiming to spur groundbreaking research and practical solutions of AI for environmental sustainability, we argue that AI can support the derivation of culturally appropriate organizational processes and individual practices to reduce the natural resource and energy intensity of human activities. The true value of AI will not be in how it enables society to reduce its energy, water, and land use intensities, but rather, at a higher level, how it facilitates and fosters environmental governance. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that research regarding AI for sustainability is challenged by (1) overreliance on historical data in machine learning models, (2) uncertain human behavioral responses to AI-based interventions, (3) increased cybersecurity risks, (4) adverse impacts of AI applications, and (5) difficulties in measuring effects of intervention strategies. The review indicates that future studies of AI for sustainability should incorporate (1) multilevel views, (2) systems dynamics approaches, (3) design thinking, (4) psychological and sociological considerations, and (5) economic value considerations to show how AI can deliver immediate solutions without introducing long-term threats to environmental sus- tainability.

AB Accurate and robust wind speed forecasting is essential for the planning, scheduling and maintenance of wind power. In this study, a novel wind speed multistep prediction model is proposed by combing the VMD (Variational Mode Decomposition), SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network and ELM (Extreme Learning Machine), in which, the VMD is employed to decompose the original wind speed data into a series of sub-layers; the SSA is adopted to further extract the trend information of all the sub layers; the LSTM network is used to complete the forecasting for the low-frequency sub-layers obtained by the VMD-SSA; and the ELM is used to complete the forecasting for the high-frequency sub-layers obtained by the VMD-SSA. To investigate the multistep prediction performance of the proposed models, eight models are included in the comparisons. The four experiments results show that: (a) among all the involved models, the proposed model has the best multistep prediction performance; (b) compared to the other involved models, the proposed model is more effective and robust in extracting the trend information.

AB In recent years, the deep learning is applied to the field of traffic sign detection methods which achieves excellent performance. However, there are two main challenges in traffic sign detection to be solve urgently. For one thing, some traffic signs of small size are more difficult to detect than those of large size so that the small traffic signs are undetected. For another, some false signs are always detected because of interferences caused by the illumination variation, bad weather and some signs similar to the true traffic signs. Therefore, to solve the undetection and false detection, we first propose a cascaded R-CNN to obtain the multiscale features in pyramids. Each layer of the cascaded network except the first layer fuses the output bounding box of the previous one layer for joint training. This method contributes to the traffic sign detection. Then, we propose a multiscale attention method to obtain the weighted multiscale features by dot-product and softmax, which is summed to fine the features to highlight the traffic sign features and improve the accuracy of the traffic sign detection. Finally, we increase the number of difficult negative samples for dataset balance and data augmentation in the training to relieve the interference by complex environment and similar false traffic signs. The data augment method expands the German traffic sign training dataset by simulation of complex environment changes. We conduct numerous experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The accuracy and recall rate of our method are 98.7; and 90.5; in GTSDB, 99.7; and 83.62; in CCTSDB and 98.9; and 85.6; in Lisa dataset respectively.

TI DehazeNet: An End-to-End System for Single Image Haze Removal

AB Single image haze removal is a challenging ill-posed problem. Existing methods use various constraints/priors to get plausible dehazing solutions. The key to achieve haze removal is to estimate a medium transmission map for an input hazy image. In this paper, we propose a trainable end-to-end system called DehazeNet, for medium transmission estimation. DehazeNet takes a hazy image as input, and outputs its medium transmission map that is subsequently used to recover a haze-free image via atmospheric scattering model. DehazeNet adopts convolutional neural network-based deep architecture, whose layers are specially designed to embody the established assumptions/priors in image dehazing. Specifically, the layers of Maxout units are used for feature extraction, which can generate almost all haze-relevant features. We also propose a novel nonlinear activation function in DehazeNet, called bilateral rectified linear unit, which is able to improve the quality of recovered haze-free image. We establish connections between the components of the proposed DehazeNet and those used in existing methods. Experiments on benchmark images show that DehazeNet achieves superior performance over existing methods, yet keeps efficient and easy to use.

AB In recent years, the haze has caused serious troubles to peoples lives, with the continuous increase of PM2.5 emissions. The accurate prediction of PM2.5 is very crucial for policy makers to make predictive measures. Due to the nonlinearity of the PM2.5 time series, it is difficult to predict accurately. Despite some studies about PM2.5 being proposed, the problem of the LSTM (long short-term memory) gradient disappearance and random selection of wavelet orders and layers isnt still solved. In this study, a novel model based on WT (wavelet transform)-SAE (stacked autoencoder)-LSTM is proposed. Firstly, six study sites from China are taken as examples and WT is used to decompose PM2.5 time series into several low-and high- frequency components based on different samples. Secondly, the decomposed components are predicted based on SAE-LSTM. Finally, the predicted results are reconstructed in view of all low-and high-frequency components and the predicted results are obtained. The results imply that: (1) the forecasting performance of SAE-LSTM is better than that of other models (e.g., BP (back propagation)) used for comparison; (2) for six different PM 2.5 samples, four orders five layers, five orders six layers, five orders seven layers, three orders six layers, five orders seven layers, and five orders six layers are the most appropriate. The conclusion that such a novel model may help to enhance the accuracy of PM 2.5 prediction can be drawn.

AB We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel-wise segmentation termed SegNet. This core trainable segmentation engine consists of an encoder network, a corresponding decoder network followed by a pixel-wise classification layer. The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network [1]. The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel-wise classification. The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map(s). Specifically, the decoder uses pooling indices computed in the max-pooling step of the corresponding encoder to perform non-linear upsampling. This eliminates the need for learning to upsample. The upsampled maps are sparse and are then convolved with trainable filters to produce dense feature maps. We compare our proposed architecture with the widely adopted FCN [2] and also with the well known DeepLab-LargeFOV [3], DeconvNet [4] architectures. This comparison reveals the memory versus accuracy trade-off involved in achieving good segmentation performance. SegNet was primarily motivated by scene understanding applications. Hence, it is designed to be efficient both in terms of memory and computational time during inference. It is also significantly smaller in the number of trainable parameters than other competing architectures and can be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent. We also performed a controlled benchmark of SegNet and other architectures on both road scenes and SUN RGB-D indoor scene segmentation tasks. These quantitative assessments show that SegNet provides good performance with competitive inference time and most efficient inference memory-wise as compared to other architectures. We also provide a Caffe implementation of SegNet and a web demo at http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB We propose a deep bilinear model for blind image quality assessment that works for both synthetically and authentically distorted images. Our model constitutes two streams of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specializing in two distortion scenarios separately. For synthetic distortions, we first pre-train a CNN to classify the distortion type and the level of an input image, whose ground truth label is readily available at a large scale. For authentic distortions, we make use of a pre-train CNN (VGG-16) for the image classification task. The two feature sets are bilinearly pooled into one representation for a final quality prediction. We fine-tune the whole network on the target databases using a variant of stochastic gradient descent. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and authentic IQA databases. Furthermore, we verify the generalizability of our method on the large-scale Waterloo Exploration Database, and demonstrate its competitiveness using the group maximum differentiation competition methodology.

ID RATE-DISTORTION OPTIMIZATION; OPTIMAL BIT ALLOCATION; FRAME LEVEL
AB To provide excellent visual experience for customers, virtual reality (VR) sources require higher resolutions and better visual quality than traditional picture sequences. The content of a VR video can be mapped into a sphere by playing devices to present a 360 scene, which is usually called VR360 in industrial community. The most popular formats for VR360 sources are the equirectangular projection (ERP) and the cubemap projection (CMP). Both ERP and CMP pictures can be effectively projected to a virtual three-dimensional spherical surface for rendering. It brings a new challenge to the compression of VR video sources, which is how to reallocate proper bit-rate to match mainstream projection formats. The most intuitive way to deal with this challenge is to empirically assign a fixed quantization parameter (QP) to each coding unit according to its position, which evidently lacks precision, rationality, and thus, degrades coding performance. This research proposes a new entropy equilibrium optimization (EEO) methodology to enhance the coding performance of VR360 videos. Specifically, we develop a spherical bit-rate equalization strategy to obtain a block-level Lagrangian multiplier for the rate-distortion optimization process in video coding. The appropriate QP value for each block is then dynamically determined in accordance with its. Based on our EEO methodology, we develop two algorithms, EEOA-ERP and EEOA-CMP, to enhance compression efficiency for the ERP and CMP pictures, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that both algorithms achieve significant BD-Rate savings and outperform the HM16.17 platform for all-intra (AI), low-delay (LD) and random-access (RA) configurations, respectively. Concretely, compared with the state-of-the-art algorithm WSU-ERP, the proposed EEOA-ERP achieves BD-Rate saving of 0.37% in LD configuration. Furthermore, the proposed EEOA-CMP gains 2.6% on objective quality in RA configuration when compared with the HM16.17 VR CMP under the common test condition.

AB Current approaches for accurate identification, classification, and quantification of biotic and abiotic stresses in crop research and production are predominantly visual and require specialized training. However, such techniques are hindered by subjectivity resulting from inter-and intrarater cognitive variability. This translates to erroneous decisions and a significant waste of resources. Here, we demonstrate a machine learning framework's ability to identify and classify a diverse set of foliar stresses in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] with remarkable accuracy. We also present an explanation mechanism, using the top-K high-resolution feature maps that isolate the visual symptoms used to make predictions. This unsupervised identification of visual symptoms provides a quantitative measure of stress severity, allowing for identification (type of foliar stress), classification (low, medium, or high stress), and quantification (stress severity) in a single framework without detailed symptom annotation by experts. We reliably identified and classified several biotic (bacterial and fungal diseases) and abiotic (chemical injury and nutrient deficiency) stresses by learning from over 25,000 images. The learned model is robust to input image perturbations, demonstrating viability for high-throughput deployment. We also noticed that the learned model appears to be agnostic to species, seemingly demonstrating an ability of transfer learning. The availability of an explainable model that can consistently, rapidly, and accurately identify and quantify foliar stresses would have significant implications in scientific research, plant breeding, and crop production. The trained model could be deployed in mobile platforms (e.g., unmanned air vehicles and automated ground scouts) for rapid, large-scale scouting or as a mobile application for real-time detection of stress by farmers and researchers.

AB Deep learning is becoming an increasingly important tool for image reconstruction in fluorescence microscopy. We review state-of-the-art applications such as image restoration and super-resolution imaging, and discuss how the latest deep learning research could be applied to other image reconstruction tasks. Despite its successes, deep learning also poses substantial challenges and has limits. We discuss key questions, including how to obtain training data, whether discovery of unknown structures is possible, and the danger of inferring unsubstantiated image details.

AB People are increasingly purchasing (e.g., food, clothes) and consuming (e.g., movies, courses) online where, traditionally, the sensory interaction has mostly been limited to visual, and to a lesser extent, auditory inputs. However, other sensory interfaces (e.g., including touch screens, together with a range of virtual, and augmented solutions) are increasingly being made available to people to interact online. Moreover, recent progress in the field of human-computer interaction means that online environments will likely engage more of the senses and become more connected with offline environments in the coming years. This expansion will likely coincide with an increasing engagement with the consumer's more emotional senses, namely touch/haptics, and possibly even olfaction. Forward-thinking marketers and researchers will therefore need to appropriate the latest tools/technologies in order to deliver richer online experiences for tomorrow's consumers. This review is designed to help the interested reader better understand what sensory marketing in a digital context can offer, thus hopefully opening the way for further research and development in the area.

ID GUIDE
AB Fatigue cracking (FC) on asphalt pavements is one of the most critical performance indicators in the AASHTO Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). However, many recent studies have shown that the accuracy of the FC transfer function is unsatisfactory even after local calibration. This study approached this issue using the highly flexible neural networks through the deep learning framework called the Tensorflow. The data involved were extracted from the reports for the project NCHRP 01-37A, on which the calibration of the MEPDG transfer functions was based. The similarity between the FC transfer function and the neural network was discussed. A total of twelve neural network models divided into two groups were constructed. One group had only two nodes in the input layer and was used to represent the transfer function. The other contained an input layer of fourteen nodes that were used to introduce more relevant information for potentially higher predictive performance. The results indicated that, when properly designed, a neural network model could significantly outperform the FC transfer function. Comparing the FC transfer function with the network composed of an input layer of fourteen nodes and four hidden layers, the coefficient was increased from 0.008 to 0.613, while the mean absolute error dropped by 30%. Compared with the best model with an input layer of two nodes, the model with four hidden layers and fourteen nodes in the input layer increased the
   R 2
   by 56% while decreased the mean absolute error (MAE) by 29%.

AB Fully Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) has the advantages of all-weather, day and night observation and high resolution capabilities. The collected data are usually sorted in Sinclair matrix, coherence or covariance matrices which are directly related to physical properties of natural media and backscattering mechanism. Additional information related to the nature of scattering medium can be exploited through polarimetric decomposition theorems. Accordingly, PolSAR image classification gains increasing attentions from remote sensing communities in recent years. However, the above polarimetric measurements or parameters cannot provide sufficient information for accurate PolSAR image classification in some scenarios, e.g. in complex urban areas where different scattering mediums may exhibit similar PolSAR response due to couples of unavoidable reasons. Inspired by the complementarity between spectral and spatial features bringing remarkable improvements in optical image classification, the complementary information between polarimetric and spatial features may also contribute to PolSAR image classification. Therefore, the roles of textural features such as contrast, dissimilarity, homogeneity and local range, morphological profiles (MPs) in PolSAR image classification are investigated using two advanced ensemble learning (EL) classifiers: Random Forest and Rotation Forest. Supervised Wishart classifier and support vector machines (SVMs) are used as benchmark classifiers for the evaluation and comparison purposes. Experimental results with three Radarsat-2 images in quad polarization mode indicate that classification accuracies could be significantly increased by integrating spatial and polarimetric features using ensemble learning strategies. Rotation Forest can get better accuracy than SVM and Random Forest, in the meantime, Random Forest is much faster than Rotation Forest.

AB As a key technology of enabling Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in 5G era, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have quickly attracted widespread attention. However, it is challenging to run computation-intensive DNN-based tasks on mobile devices due to the limited computation resources. What's worse, traditional cloud-assisted DNN inference is heavily hindered by the significant wide-area network latency, leading to poor real-time performance as well as low quality of user experience. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose Edgent, a framework that leverages edge computing for DNN collaborative inference through device-edge synergy. Edgent exploits two design knobs: (1) DNN partitioning that adaptively partitions computation between device and edge for purpose of coordinating the powerful cloud resource and the proximal edge resource for real-time DNN inference; (2) DNN right-sizing that further reduces computing latency via early exiting inference at an appropriate intermediate DNN layer. In addition, considering the potential network fluctuation in real-world deployment, Edgent is properly design to specialize for both static and dynamic network environment. Specifically, in a static environment where the bandwidth changes slowly, Edgent derives the best configurations with the assist of regression-based prediction models, while in a dynamic environment where the bandwidth varies dramatically, Edgent generates the best execution plan through the online change point detection algorithm that maps the current bandwidth state to the optimal configuration. We implement Edgent prototype based on the Raspberry Pi and the desktop PC and the extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate Edgent's effectiveness in enabling on-demand low-latency edge intelligence.

AB In recent years, there are numerous works been proposed to leverage the techniques of deep learning to improve social-aware recommendation performance. In most cases, it requires a larger number of data to train a robust deep learning model, which contains a lot of parameters to fit training data. However, both data of user ratings and social networks are facing critical sparse problem, which makes it not easy to train a robust deep neural network model. Towards this problem, we propose a novel correlative denoising autoencoder (CoDAE) method by taking correlations between users with multiple roles into account to learn robust representations from sparse inputs of ratings and social networks for recommendation. We develop the CoDAE model by utilizing three separated autoencoders to learn user features with roles of rater, truster and trustee, respectively. Especially, on account of that each input unit of user vectors with roles of truster and trustee is corresponding to a particular user, we propose to utilize shared parameters to learn common information of the units that corresponding to same users. Moreover, we propose a related regularization term to learn correlations between user features that learnt by the three subnetworks of CoDAE model. We further conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the proposed method on two public datasets for Top-N recommendation task. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on rank-sensitive metrics of MAP and NDCG.

AB This article investigates an adaptive reinforcement learning (RL) optimal control design problem for a class of nonstrict-feedback discrete-time systems. Based on the neural network (NN) approximating ability and RL control design technique, an adaptive backstepping RL optimal controller and a minimal learning parameter (MLP) adaptive RL optimal controller are developed by establishing a novel strategic utility function and introducing external function terms. It is proved that the proposed adaptive RL optimal controllers can guarantee that all signals in the closed-loop systems are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The main feature is that the proposed schemes can solve the optimal control problem that the previous literature cannot deal with. Furthermore, the proposed MPL adaptive optimal control scheme can reduce the number of adaptive laws, and thus the computational complexity is decreased. Finally, the simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed optimal control schemes.

AB In this work, we present a new physics informed neural network (PINN) algorithm for solving brittle fracture problems. While most of the PINN algorithms available in the literature minimize the residual of the governing partial differential equation, the proposed approach takes a different path by minimizing the variational energy of the system. Additionally, we modify the neural network output such that the boundary conditions associated with the problem are exactly satisfied. Compared to the conventional residual based PINN, the proposed approach has two major advantages. First, the imposition of boundary conditions is relatively simpler and more robust. Second, the order of derivatives present in the functional form of the variational energy is of lower order than in the residual form used in conventional PINN and hence, training the network is faster. To compute the total variational energy of the system, an efficient scheme that takes as input a geometry described by spline based CAD model and employs Gauss quadrature rules for numerical integration, has been proposed. Moreover, we note that for obtaining the crack path, the proposed PINN has to be trained at each load/displacement step, which can potentially make the algorithm computationally inefficient. To address this issue, we propose to use the concept 'transfer learning' wherein, instead of re-training the complete network, we only re-train the network partially while keeping the weights and the biases corresponding to the other portions fixed. With this setup, the computational efficiency of the proposed approach is significantly enhanced. The proposed approach is used to solve six fracture mechanics problems. For all the examples, results obtained using the proposed approach match closely with the results available in the literature. For the first two examples, we compare the results obtained using the proposed approach with the conventional residual based neural network results. For both the problems, the proposed approach is found to yield better accuracy compared to conventional residual based PINN algorithms.

AB Deep learning is a recently developed feature representation technique for data with complicated structures, which has great potential for soft sensing of industrial processes. However, most deep networks mainly focus on hierarchical feature learning for the raw observed input data. For soft sensor applications, it is important to reduce irrelevant information and extract quality-relevant features from the raw input data for quality prediction. To deal with this problem, a novel deep learning network is proposed for quality-relevant feature representation in this article, which is based on stacked quality-driven autoencoder (SQAE). First, a quality-driven autoencoder (QAE) is designed by exploiting the quality data to guide feature extraction with the constraint that the potential features should largely reconstruct the input layer data and the quality data at the output layer. In this way, quality-relevant features can be captured by QAE. Then, by stacking multiple QAEs to construct the deep SQAE network, SQAE can gradually reduce irrelevant features and learn hierarchical quality-relevant features. Finally, the high-level quality-relevant features can be directly applied for soft sensing of the quality variables. The effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed deep learning model are validated on an industrial debutanizer column process.

AB Supervised approaches classify input data using a set of representative samples for each class, known as training samples. The collection of such samples is expensive and time demanding. Hence, unsupervised feature learning, which has a quick access to arbitrary amounts of unlabeled data, is conceptually of high interest. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, fully Conv-Deconv network, for unsupervised spectral-spatial feature learning of hyperspectral images, which is able to be trained in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, our network is based on the so-called encoder-decoder paradigm, i.e., the input 3-D hyperspectral patch is first transformed into a typically lower dimensional space via a convolutional subnetwork (encoder), and then expanded to reproduce the initial data by a deconvolutional subnetwork (decoder). However, during the experiment, we found that such a network is not easy to be optimized. To address this problem, we refine the proposed network architecture by incorporating: 1) residual learning and 2) a new unpooling operation that can use memorized max-pooling indexes. Moreover, to understand the "black box," we make an in-depth study of the learned feature maps in the experimental analysis. A very interesting discovery is that some specific "neurons" in the first residual block of the proposed network own good description power for semantic visual patterns in the object level, which provide an opportunity to achieve "free" object detection. This paper, for the first time in the remote sensing community, proposes an end-to-end fully Conv-Deconv network for unsupervised spectral-spatial feature learning. Moreover, this paper also introduces an in-depth investigation of learned features. Experimental results on two widely used hyperspectral data, Indian Pines and Pavia University, demonstrate competitive performance obtained by the proposed methodology compared with other studied approaches.

AB Representing unresolved moist convection in coarse-scale climate models remains one of the main bottlenecks of current climate simulations. Many of the biases present with parameterized convection are strongly reduced when convection is explicitly resolved (i.e., in cloud resolving models at high spatial resolution approximately a kilometer or so). We here present a novel approach to convective parameterization based on machine learning, using an aquaplanet with prescribed sea surface temperatures as a proof of concept. A deep neural network is trained with a superparameterized version of a climate model in which convection is resolved by thousands of embedded 2-D cloud resolving models. The machine learning representation of convection, which we call the Cloud Brain (CBRAIN), can skillfully predict many of the convective heating, moistening, and radiative features of superparameterization that are most important to climate simulation, although an unintended side effect is to reduce some of the superparameterization's inherent variance. Since as few as three months' high-frequency global training data prove sufficient to provide this skill, the approach presented here opens up a new possibility for a future class of convection parameterizations in climate models that are built top-down, that is, by learning salient features of convection from unusually explicit simulations.
   Plain Language Summary The representation of cloud radiative effects and the atmospheric heating and moistening due to moist convection remains a major challenge in current generation climate models, leading to a large spread in climate prediction. Here we show that neural networks trained on a high-resolution model in which moist convection is resolved can be an appealing technique to tackle and better represent moist convection in coarse resolution climate models.

AB Background
   Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients often demonstrate varying clinical courses and outcomes, even within the same tumor stage. This study explores deep learning applications in medical imaging allowing for the automated quantification of radiographic characteristics and potentially improving patient stratification.
   Methods and findings
   We performed an integrative analysis on 7 independent datasets across 5 institutions totaling 1,194 NSCLC patients (age median = 68.3 years [range 32.5-93.3], survival median = 1.7 years [range 0.0-11.7]). Using external validation in computed tomography (CT) data, we identified prognostic signatures using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) for patients treated with radiotherapy (n = 771, age median = 68.0 years [range 32.5-93.3], survival median = 1.3 years [range 0.0-11.7]). We then employed a transfer learning approach to achieve the same for surgery patients (n = 391, age median = 69.1 years [range 37.2-88.0], survival median = 3.1 years [range 0.0-8.8]). We found that the CNN predictions were significantly associated with 2-year overall survival from the start of respective treatment for radiotherapy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.70 [95% CI 0.63-0.78], p < 0.001) and surgery (AUC = 0.71 [95% CI 0.60-0.82], p < 0.001) patients. The CNN was also able to significantly stratify patients into low and high mortality risk groups in both the radiotherapy (p < 0.001) and surgery (p = 0.03) datasets. Additionally, the CNN was found to significantly outperform random forest models built on clinical parameters-including age, sex, and tumor node metastasis stage-as well as demonstrate high robustness against test-retest (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.91) and inter-reader (Spearman's rank-order correlation = 0.88) variations. To gain a better understanding of the characteristics captured by the CNN, we identified regions with the most contribution towards predictions and highlighted the importance of tumor-surrounding tissue in patient stratification. We also present preliminary findings on the biological basis of the captured phenotypes as being linked to cell cycle and transcriptional processes. Limitations include the retrospective nature of this study as well as the opaque black box nature of deep learning networks.
   Conclusions
   Our results provide evidence that deep learning networks may be used for mortality risk stratification based on standard-of-care CT images from NSCLC patients. This evidence motivates future research into better deciphering the clinical and biological basis of deep learning networks as well as validation in prospective data.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Recently, Deep Learning, especially through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been widely used to enable the extraction of highly representative features. This is done among the network layers by filtering, selecting, and using these features in the last fully connected layers for pattern classification. However, CNN training for automated endoscopic image classification still provides a challenge due to the lack of large and publicly available annotated databases. In this work we explore Deep Learning for the automated classification of colonic polyps using different configurations for training CNNs from scratch (or full training) and distinct architectures of pretrained CNNs tested on 8-HD-endoscopic image databases acquired using different modalities. We compare our results with some commonly used features for colonic polyp classification and the good results suggest that features learned by CNNs trained from scratch and the "off-the-shelf" CNNs features can be highly relevant for automated classification of colonic polyps. Moreover, we also show that the combination of classical features and "off-the-shelf" CNNs features can be a good approach to further improve the results.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.
   Main body: Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.
   Conclusion: The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems as a data acquisition platform and as a measurement instrument are becoming attractive for many surveying applications in civil engineering. Their performance, however, is not well understood for these particular tasks. The scope of the presented work is the performance evaluation of a UAV system that was built to rapidly and autonomously acquire mobile three-dimensional (3D) mapping data. Details to the components of the UAV system (hardware and control software) are explained. A novel program for photogrammetric flight planning and its execution for the generation of 3D point clouds from digital mobile images is explained. A performance model for estimating the position error was developed and tested in several realistic construction environments. Test results are presented as they relate to large excavation and earth moving construction sites. The experiences with the developed UAV system are useful to researchers or practitioners in need for successfully adapting UAV technology for their application(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); deep learning; face recognition;
   multimodal system
AB Face images appearing in multimedia applications, e.g., social networks and digital entertainment, usually exhibit dramatic pose, illumination, and expression variations, resulting in considerable performance degradation for traditional face recognition algorithms. This paper proposes a comprehensive deep learning framework to jointly learn face representation using multimodal information. The proposed deep learning structure is composed of a set of elaborately designed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a three-layer stacked auto-encoder (SAE). The set of CNNs extracts complementary facial features from multimodal data. Then, the extracted features are concatenated to form a high-dimensional feature vector, whose dimension is compressed by SAE. All of the CNNs are trained using a subset of 9,000 subjects from the publicly available CASIA-WebFace database, which ensures the reproducibility of this work. Using the proposed single CNN architecture and limited training data, 98.43% verification rate is achieved on the LFW database. Benefitting from the complementary information contained in multimodal data, our small ensemble system achieves higher than 99.0% recognition rate on LFW using publicly available training set.

AB Although it has been shown that immersive virtual reality (IVR) can be used to induce illusions of ownership over a virtual body (VB), information on whether this changes implicit interpersonal attitudes is meager. Here we demonstrate that embodiment of light-skinned participants in a dark-skinned VB significantly reduced implicit racial bias against dark-skinned people, in contrast to embodiment in light-skinned, purple-skinned or with no VB. 60 females participated in this between-groups experiment, with a VB substituting their own, with full-body visuomotor synchrony, reflected also in a-virtual mirror. A racial Implicit Association Test (IAT) was administered at least three days prior to the experiment, and immediately after the IVR exposure. The change from pre- to post-experience IAT scores suggests that the dark-skinned embodied condition decreased implicit racial bias more than the other conditions. Thus, embodiment may change negative interpersonal attitudes and thus represent a powerful tool for exploring such fundamental psychological and societal phenomena. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI COVID-Net: a tailored deep convolutional neural network design for
   detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a devastating effect on the health and well-being of the global population. A critical step in the fight against COVID-19 is effective screening of infected patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiology examination using chest radiography. It was found in early studies that patients present abnormalities in chest radiography images that are characteristic of those infected with COVID-19. Motivated by this and inspired by the open source efforts of the research community, in this study we introduce COVID-Net, a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the detection of COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray (CXR) images that is open source and available to the general public. To the best of the authors' knowledge, COVID-Net is one of the first open source network designs for COVID-19 detection from CXR images at the time of initial release. We also introduce COVIDx, an open access benchmark dataset that we generated comprising of 13,975 CXR images across 13,870 patient patient cases, with the largest number of publicly available COVID-19 positive cases to the best of the authors' knowledge. Furthermore, we investigate how COVID-Net makes predictions using an explainability method in an attempt to not only gain deeper insights into critical factors associated with COVID cases, which can aid clinicians in improved screening, but also audit COVID-Net in a responsible and transparent manner to validate that it is making decisions based on relevant information from the CXR images. By no means a production-ready solution, the hope is that the open access COVID-Net, along with the description on constructing the open source COVIDx dataset, will be leveraged and build upon by both researchers and citizen data scientists alike to accelerate the development of highly accurate yet practical deep learning solutions for detecting COVID-19 cases and accelerate treatment of those who need it the most.

AB Colour is the first quality attribute of food evaluated by consumers, and is therefore an important component of food quality relevant to market acceptance. Rapid and objective measurement of food colour is required in quality control for the commercial grading of products. Computer vision is a promising technique currently investigated for food colour measurement, especially with the ability of providing a detailed characterization of colour uniformity at pixel-based level. This paper reviews the fundamentals and applications of computer vision for food colour measurement. Introduction of colour space and traditional colour measurements is also given. At last, advantages and disadvantages of computer vision for colour measurement are analyzed and its future trends are proposed.

AB Guided by brain-like 'spiking' computational frameworks, neuromorphic computing-brain-inspired computing for machine intelligence-promises to realize artificial intelligence while reducing the energy requirements of computing platforms. This interdisciplinary field began with the implementation of silicon circuits for biological neural routines, but has evolved to encompass the hardware implementation of algorithms with spike-based encoding and event-driven representations. Here we provide an overview of the developments in neuromorphic computing for both algorithms and hardware and highlight the fundamentals of learning and hardware frameworks. We discuss the main challenges and the future prospects of neuromorphic computing, with emphasis on algorithm-hardware codesign.

TI Searching for exotic particles in high-energy physics with deep learning
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Collisions at high-energy particle colliders are a traditionally fruitful source of exotic particle discoveries. Finding these rare particles requires solving difficult signal-versus-background classification problems, hence machine-learning approaches are often used. Standard approaches have relied on 'shallow' machine-learning models that have a limited capacity to learn complex nonlinear functions of the inputs, and rely on a painstaking search through manually constructed nonlinear features. Progress on this problem has slowed, as a variety of techniques have shown equivalent performance. Recent advances in the field of deep learning make it possible to learn more complex functions and better discriminate between signal and background classes. Here, using benchmark data sets, we show that deep-learning methods need no manually constructed inputs and yet improve the classification metric by as much as 8% over the best current approaches. This demonstrates that deep-learning approaches can improve the power of collider searches for exotic particles.

AB Microsatellite instability determines whether patients with gastrointestinal cancer respond exceptionally well to immunotherapy. However, in clinical practice, not every patient is tested for MSI, because this requires additional genetic or immunohistochemical tests. Here we show that deep residual learning can predict MSI directly from H&E histology, which is ubiquitously available. This approach has the potential to provide immunotherapy to a much broader subset of patients with gastrointestinal cancer.

AB Easy-to-use collaborative robotics solutions, where human workers and robots share their skills, are entering the market, thus becoming the new frontier in industrial robotics. They allow to combine the advantages of robots, which enjoy high levels of accuracy, speed and repeatability, with the flexibility and cognitive skills of human workers. However, to achieve an efficient human-robot collaboration, several challenges need to be tackled. First, a safe interaction must be guaranteed to prevent harming humans having a direct contact with the moving robot. Additionally, to take full advantage of human skills, it is important that intuitive user interfaces are properly designed, so that human operators can easily program and interact with the robot. In this survey paper, an extensive review on human-robot collaboration in industrial environment is provided, with specific focus on issues related to physical and cognitive interaction. The commercially available solutions are also presented and the main industrial applications where collaborative robotic is advantageous are discussed, highlighting how collaborative solutions are intended to improve the efficiency of the system and which the open issue are.

DE Object recognition; vision and scene understanding
AB We study the problem of object recognition for categories for which we have no training examples, a task also called zero-data or zero-shot learning. This situation has hardly been studied in computer vision research, even though it occurs frequently; the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes, and image collections have been formed and suitably annotated for only a few of them. To tackle the problem, we introduce attribute-based classification: Objects are identified based on a high-level description that is phrased in terms of semantic attributes, such as the object's color or shape. Because the identification of each such property transcends the specific learning task at hand, the attribute classifiers can be prelearned independently, for example, from existing image data sets unrelated to the current task. Afterward, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In this paper, we also introduce a new data set, Animals with Attributes, of over 30,000 images of 50 animal classes, annotated with 85 semantic attributes. Extensive experiments on this and two more data sets show that attribute-based classification indeed is able to categorize images without access to any training images of the target classes.

AB Crop yield is a highly complex trait determined by multiple factors such as genotype, environment, and their interactions. Accurate yield prediction requires fundamental understanding of the functional relationship between yield and these interactive factors, and to reveal such relationship requires both comprehensive datasets and powerful algorithms. In the 2018 Syngenta Crop Challenge, Syngenta released several large datasets that recorded the genotype and yield performances of 2,267 maize hybrids planted in 2,247 locations between 2008 and 2016 and asked participants to predict the yield performance in 2017. As one of the winning teams, we designed a deep neural network (DNN) approach that took advantage of state-of-the-art modeling and solution techniques. Our model was found to have a superior prediction accuracy, with a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) being 12%of the average yield and 50%of the standard deviation for the validation dataset using predicted weather data. With perfect weather data, the RMSE would be reduced to 11% of the average yield and 46% of the standard deviation. We also performed feature selection based on the trained DNN model, which successfully decreased the dimension of the input space without significant drop in the prediction accuracy. Our computational results suggested that this model significantly outperformed other popular methods such as Lasso, shallow neural networks (SNN), and regression tree (RT). The results also revealed that environmental factors had a greater effect on the crop yield than genotype.

AB Technological advances in genomics and imaging have led to an explosion of molecular and cellular profiling data from large numbers of samples. This rapid increase in biological data dimension and acquisition rate is challenging conventional analysis strategies. Modern machine learning methods, such as deep learning, promise to leverage very large data sets for finding hidden structure within them, and for making accurate predictions. In this review, we discuss applications of this new breed of analysis approaches in regulatory genomics and cellular imaging. We provide background of what deep learning is, and the settings in which it can be successfully applied to derive biological insights. In addition to presenting specific applications and providing tips for practical use, we also highlight possible pitfalls and limitations to guide computational biologists when and how to make the most use of this new technology.

AB Deep generative adversarial networks (GANs) are the emerging technology in drug discovery and biomarker development. In our recent work, we demonstrated a proof-of-concept of implementing deep generative adversarial autoencoder (AAE) to identify new molecular fingerprints with predefined anticancer properties. Another popular generative model is the variational autoencoder (VAE), which is based on deep neural architectures. In this work, we developed an advanced AAE model for molecular feature extraction problems, and demonstrated its advantages compared to VAE in terms of (a) adjustability in generating molecular fingerprints; (b) capacity of processing very large molecular data sets; and (c) efficiency in unsupervised pretraining for regression model. Our results suggest that the proposed AAE model significantly enhances the capacity and efficiency of development of the new molecules with specific anticancer properties using the deep generative models.

AB This contribution provides a review of fundamental goals, development and future perspectives of driver assistance systems. Mobility is a fundamental desire of mankind. Virtually any society strives for safe and efficient mobility at low ecological and economic costs. Nevertheless, its technical implementation significantly differs among societies, depending on their culture and their degree of industrialization. A potential evolutionary roadmap for driver assistance systems is discussed. Emerging from systems based on proprioceptive sensors, such as ABS or ESC, we review the progress incented by the use of exteroceptive sensors such as radar, video, or lidar. While the ultimate goal of automated and cooperative traffic still remains a vision of the future, intermediate steps towards that aim can be realized through systems that mitigate or avoid collisions in selected driving situations. Research extends the state-of-the-art in automated driving in urban traffic and in cooperative driving, the latter addressing communication and collaboration between different vehicles, as well as cooperative vehicle operation by its driver and its machine intelligence. These steps are considered important for the interim period, until reliable unsupervised automated driving for all conceivable traffic situations becomes available. The prospective evolution of driver assistance systems will be stimulated by several technological, societal and market trends. The paper closes with a view on current research fields.

AB Most of the existing deep-learning-based methods are difficult to effectively deal with the challenges faced for geospatial object detection such as rotation variations and appearance ambiguity. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel deep-learning-based object detection framework including region proposal network (RPN) and local-contextual feature fusion network designed for remote sensing images. Specifically, the RPN includes additional multiangle anchors besides the conventional multiscale and multiaspect-ratio ones, and thus can deal with the multiangle and multiscale characteristics of geospatial objects. To address the appearance ambiguity problem, we propose a double-channel feature fusion network that can learn local and contextual properties along two independent pathways. The two kinds of features are later combined in the final layers of processing in order to form a powerful joint representation. Comprehensive evaluations on a publicly available ten-class object detection data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Knowledge over the number of animals in large wildlife reserves is a vital necessity for park rangers in their efforts to protect endangered species. Manual animal censuses are dangerous and expensive, hence Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with consumer level digital cameras are becoming a popular alternative tool to estimate livestock. Several works have been proposed that semi-automatically process UAV images to detect animals, of which some employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a recent family of deep learning algorithms that proved very effective in object detection in large datasets from computer vision. However, the majority of works related to wildlife focuses only on small datasets (typically subsets of UAV campaigns), which might be detrimental when presented with the sheer scale of real study areas for large mammal census. Methods may yield thousands of false alarms in such cases. In this paper, we study how to scale CNNs to large wildlife census tasks and present a number of recommendations to train a CNN on a large UAV dataset. We further introduce novel evaluation protocols that are tailored to censuses and model suitability for subsequent human verification of detections. Using our recommendations, we are able to train a CNN reducing the number of false positives by an order of magnitude compared to previous state-of-the-art. Setting the requirements at 90% recall, our CNN allows to reduce the amount of data required for manual verification by three times, thus making it possible for rangers to screen all the data acquired efficiently and to detect almost all animals in the reserve automatically.

AB Advances in computing technology have fostered the development of new and powerful deep learning (DL) techniques, which have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of applications. Particularly, DL methods have been successfully used to classify remotely sensed data collected by Earth Observation (EO) instruments. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a hot topic in remote sensing data analysis due to the vast amount of information comprised by this kind of images, which allows for a better characterization and exploitation of the Earth surface by combining rich spectral and spatial information. However, HSI poses major challenges for supervised classification methods due to the high dimensionality of the data and the limited availability of training samples. These issues, together with the high intraclass variability (and interclass similarity) often present in HSI data-may hamper the effectiveness of classifiers. In order to solve these limitations, several DL-based architectures have been recently developed, exhibiting great potential in HSI data interpretation. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current-state-of-the-art in DL for HSI classification, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the most widely used classifiers in the literature. For each discussed method, we provide quantitative results using several well-known and widely used HSI scenes, thus providing an exhaustive comparison of the discussed techniques. The paper concludes with some remarks and hints about future challenges in the application of DL techniques to HSI classification. The source codes of the methods discussed in this paper are available from: https://github.com/mhaut/hyperspectral_deeplearning_review.

ID DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM; NETWORKS
AB In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models. The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed "DeepLab" system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 79.7 percent mIOU in the test set, and advances the results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and Cityscapes. All of our code is made publicly available online.

AB Purpose: To develop and validate a deep learning algorithm that predicts the final diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, or neither at fluorine 18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET of the brain and compare its performance to that of radiologic readers.
   Materials and Methods: Prospective F-18-FDG PET brain images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (2109 imaging studies from 2005 to 2017, 1002 patients) and retrospective independent test set (40 imaging studies from 2006 to 2016, 40 patients) were collected. Final clinical diagnosis at follow-up was recorded. Convolutional neural network of InceptionV3 architecture was trained on 90% of ADNI data set and tested on the remaining 10%, as well as the independent test set, with performance compared to radiologic readers. Model was analyzed with sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), saliency map, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.
   Results: The algorithm achieved area under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.00) when evaluated on predicting the final clinical diagnosis of AD in the independent test set (82% specificity at 100% sensitivity), an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis, which in ROC space outperformed reader performance (57% [four of seven] sensitivity, 91% [30 of 33] specificity; P<.05). Saliency map demonstrated attention to known areas of interest but with focus on the entire brain.
   Conclusion: By using fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET of the brain, a deep learning algorithm developed for early prediction of Alzheimer disease achieved 82% specificity at 100% sensitivity, an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis. (c) RSNA, 2018

AB PurposeThe radial k-space trajectory is a well-established sampling trajectory used in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging. However, the radial k-space trajectory requires a large number of radial lines for high-resolution reconstruction. Increasing the number of radial lines causes longer acquisition time, making it more difficult for routine clinical use. On the other hand, if we reduce the number of radial lines, streaking artifact patterns are unavoidable. To solve this problem, we propose a novel deep learning approach with domain adaptation to restore high-resolution MR images from under-sampled k-space data.
   MethodsThe proposed deep network removes the streaking artifacts from the artifact corrupted images. To address the situation given the limited available data, we propose a domain adaptation scheme that employs a pre-trained network using a large number of X-ray computed tomography (CT) or synthesized radial MR datasets, which is then fine-tuned with only a few radial MR datasets.
   ResultsThe proposed method outperforms existing compressed sensing algorithms, such as the total variation and PR-FOCUSS methods. In addition, the calculation time is several orders of magnitude faster than the total variation and PR-FOCUSS methods. Moreover, we found that pre-training using CT or MR data from similar organ data is more important than pre-training using data from the same modality for different organ.
   ConclusionWe demonstrate the possibility of a domain-adaptation when only a limited amount of MR data is available. The proposed method surpasses the existing compressed sensing algorithms in terms of the image quality and computation time.

AB Nanophotonics, the field that merges photonics and nanotechnology, has in recent years revolutionized the field of optics by enabling the manipulation of light-matter interactions with subwavelength structures. However, despite the many advances in this field, the design, fabrication and characterization has remained widely an iterative process in which the designer guesses a structure and solves the Maxwell's equations for it. In contrast, the inverse problem, i.e., obtaining a geometry for a desired electromagnetic response, remains a challenging and time-consuming task within the boundaries of very specific assumptions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that a novel Deep Neural Network trained with thousands of synthetic experiments is not only able to retrieve subwavelength dimensions from solely far-field measurements but is also capable of directly addressing the inverse problem. Our approach allows the rapid design and characterization of metasurface-based optical elements as well as optimal nanostructures for targeted chemicals and biomolecules, which are critical for sensing, imaging and integrated spectroscopy applications.

AB In mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, the identification and quantification of peptides and proteins heavily rely on sequence database searching or spectral library matching. The lack of accurate predictive models for fragment ion intensities impairs the realization of the full potential of these approaches. Here, we extended the ProteomeTools synthetic peptide library to 550,000 tryptic peptides and 21 million high-quality tandem mass spectra. We trained a deep neural network, termed Prosit, resulting in chromatographic retention time and fragment ion intensity predictions that exceed the quality of the experimental data. Integrating Prosit into database search pipelines led to more identifications at >10x lower false discovery rates. We show the general applicability of Prosit by predicting spectra for proteases other than trypsin, generating spectral libraries for data-independent acquisition and improving the analysis of metaproteomes. Prosit is integrated into ProteomicsDB, allowing search result re-scoring and custom spectral library generation for any organism on the basis of peptide sequence alone.

AB Converging evidence suggests that the primate ventral visual pathway encodes increasingly complex stimulus features in downstream areas. We quantitatively show that there indeed exists an explicit gradient for feature complexity in the ventral pathway of the human brain. This was achieved by mapping thousands of stimulus features of increasing complexity across the cortical sheet using a deep neural network. Our approach also revealed a fine-grained functional specialization of downstream areas of the ventral stream. Furthermore, it allowed decoding of representations from human brain activity at an unsurpassed degree of accuracy, confirming the quality of the developed approach. Stimulus features that successfully explained neural responses indicate that population receptive fields were explicitly tuned for object categorization. This provides strong support for the hypothesis that object categorization is a guiding principle in the functional organization of the primate ventral stream.

AB Background and objective: Automatic detection and classification of the masses in mammograms are still a big challenge and play a crucial role to assist radiologists for accurate diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system based on one of the regional deep learning techniques, a ROI-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is called You Only Look Once (YOLO). Although most previous studies only deal with classification of masses, our proposed YOLO-based CAD system can handle detection and classification simultaneously in one framework.
   Methods: The proposed CAD system contains four main stages: preprocessing of mammograms, feature extraction utilizing deep convolutional networks, mass detection with confidence, and finally mass classification using Fully Connected Neural Networks (FC-NNs). In this study, we utilized original 600 mammograms from Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and their augmented mammograms of 2,400 with the information of the masses and their types in training and testing our CAD. The trained YOLO-based CAD system detects the masses and then classifies their types into benign or malignant.
   Results: Our results with five-fold cross validation tests show that the proposed CAD system detects the mass location with an overall accuracy of 99.7%. The system also distinguishes between benign and malignant lesions with an overall accuracy of 97%.
   Conclusions: Our proposed system even works on some challenging breast cancer cases where the masses exist over the pectoral muscles or dense regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, almost one million gastrointestinal patients are successfully treated by Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE). It is the latest technology in the area of medical imaging for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal diseases such as ulcer, polyp, bleeding, etc. Manual diagnosis process is time-consuming and hard for doctors; therefore, researchers have proposed computerized techniques for detection and classification of these diseases. In this article, a deep learning-based method is presented for ulcer detection and gastrointestinal diseases (ulcer, polyp, bleeding) classification. Modified mask Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) based ulcer segmentation is proposed. The ulcer annotated images are utilized to train the Mask RCNN model to obtain output in the form of bounding box ulcer detected area and mask segmented region. In the classification phase, the ResNet101 pre-trained CNN model is fine-tuned through transfer learning to derive deep features. The acquired deep features are optimized through grasshopper optimization along with minimum distance fitness function. The best-selected features are finally supplied to a Multi-class Support Vector Machine (MSVM) of cubic kernel function for final classification. Experiments have been performed in two-steps; first, the ulcer segmentation results are computed through recall, precision, and Mean Overlap Coefficient (MOC). The ResNet50+FPN as backbone and training all the layers of Mask-RCNN gives best results in terms of MOC = 0.8807 and average precision = 1.0. Second, the best classification accuracy of 99.13% is achieved on the cubic SVM for K = 10. It is clearly perceived that the proposed method outperforms when compared and analyzed with the existing methods. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Artificial Intelligence Augmentation of Radiologist Performance in
   Distinguishing COVID-19 from Pneumonia of Other Origin at Chest CT
SO RADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and pneumonia of other diseases share similar CT characteristics, which contributes to the challenges in differentiating them with high accuracy.
   Purpose: To establish and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) system for differentiating COVID-19 and other pneumonia at chest CT and assessing radiologist performance without and with AI assistance.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 521 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results for COVID-19 and abnormal chest CT findings were retrospectively identified from 10 hospitals from January 2020 to April 2020. A total of 665 patients with non-COVID-19 pneumonia and definite evidence of pneumonia at chest CT were retrospectively selected from three hospitals between 2017 and 2019. To classify COVID-19 versus other pneumonia for each patient, abnormal CT slices were input into the Efficient Net B4 deep neural network architecture after lung segmentation, followed by a two-layer fully connected neural network to pool slices together. The final cohort of 1186 patients (132 583 CT slices) was divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 and equal ratio. Independent testing was performed by evaluating model performance in separate hospitals. Studies were blindly reviewed by six radiologists without and then with AI assistance.
   Results: The final model achieved a test accuracy of 96% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90%, 98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI: 83%, 100%), and a specificity of 96% (95% CI: 88%, 99%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.90. On independent testing, this model achieved an accuracy of 87% (95% CI: 82%, 90%), a sensitivity of 89% (95% CI: 81%, 94%), and a specificity of 86% (95% CI: 80%, 90%) with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.87. Assisted by the probabilities of the model, the radiologists achieved a higher average test accuracy (90% vs 85%, Delta= 5, P<.001), sensitivity (88% vs 79%, Delta = 9, P<.001), and specificity (91% vs 88%, Delta= 3, P =.001).
   Conclusion: Artificial intelligence assistance improved radiologists' performance in distinguishing coronavirus disease 2019 pneumoniafrom non-coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia at chest CT. (C) RSNA, 2020

AB Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in diverse applications; however, its use in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has emerged only recently. Here, we present an overview of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which embed a PDE into the loss of the neural network using automatic differentiation. The PINN algorithm is simple, and it can be applied to different types of PDEs, including integro-differential equations, fractional PDEs, and stochastic PDEs. Moreover, from an implementation point of view, PINNs solve inverse problems as easily as forward problems. We propose a new residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) method to improve the training efficiency of PINNs. For pedagogical reasons, we compare the PINN algorithm to a standard finite element method. We also present a Python library for PINNs, DeepXDE, which is designed to serve both as an educational tool to be used in the classroom as well as a research tool for solving problems in computational science and engineering. Specifically, DeepXDE can solve forward problems given initial and boundary conditions, as well as inverse problems given some extra measurements. DeepXDE supports complex-geometry domains based on the technique of constructive solid geometry and enables the user code to be compact, resembling closely the mathematical formulation. We introduce the usage of DeepXDE and its customizability, and we also demonstrate the capability of PINNs and the user-friendliness of DeepXDE for five different examples. More broadly, DeepXDE contributes to the more rapid development of the emerging scientific machine learning field.

AB In precision agriculture, detecting the vegetation in herbaceous crops in early season is a first and crucial step prior to addressing further objectives such as counting plants for germination monitoring, or detecting weeds for early season site specific weed management. The ultra-high resolution of UAV images, and the powerful tools provided by the Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) are the key in achieving this objective. The present research work develops an innovative thresholding OBIA algorithm based on the Otsu's method, and studies how the results of this algorithm are affected by the different segmentation parameters (scale, shape and compactness). Along with the general description of the procedure, it was specifically applied for vegetation detection in remotely-sensed images captured with two sensors (a conventional visible camera and a multispectral camera) mounted on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and acquired over fields of three different herbaceous crops (maize, sunflower and wheat). The tests analyzed the performance of the OBIA algorithm for classifying vegetation coverage as affected by different automatically selected thresholds calculated in the images of two vegetation indices: the Excess Green (ExG) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The segmentation scale parameter affected the vegetation index histograms, which led to changes in the automatic estimation of the optimal threshold value for the vegetation indices. The other parameters involved in the segmentation procedure (i.e., shape and compactness) showed minor influence on the classification accuracy. Increasing the object size, the classification error diminished until an optimum was reached. After this optimal value, increasing object size produced bigger errors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Despite the rapid adoption of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) Additive Manufacturing by industry, current processes remain largely open-loop, with limited real-time monitoring capabilities. While some machines offer powder bed visualization during builds, they lack automated analysis capability. This work presents an approach for in-situ monitoring and analysis of powder bed images with the potential to become a component of a real-time control system in an LPBF machine. Specifically, a computer vision algorithm is used to automatically detect and classify anomalies that occur during the powder spreading stage of the process. Anomaly detection and classification are implemented using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, operating on a moderately-sized training database of image patches. The performance of the final algorithm is evaluated, and its usefulness as a standalone software package is demonstrated with several case studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, which was identified in late 2019, requires special attention because of its future epidemics and possible global threats. Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.

AB Automated detection and classification of gastric infections (i.e., ulcer, polyp, esophagitis, and bleeding) through wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is still a key challenge. Doctors can identify these endoscopic diseases by using the computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems. In this article, a new fully automated system is proposed for the recognition of gastric infections through multi-type features extraction, fusion, and robust features selection. Five key steps are performed-database creation, handcrafted and convolutional neural network (CNN) deep features extraction, a fusion of extracted features, selection of best features using a genetic algorithm (GA), and recognition. In the features extraction step, discrete cosine transform, discrete wavelet transform strong color feature, and VGG16-based CNN features are extracted. Later, these features are fused by simple array concatenation and GA is performed through which best features are selected based on K-Nearest Neighbor fitness function. In the last, best selected features are provided to Ensemble classifier for recognition of gastric diseases. A database is prepared using four datasets-Kvasir, CVC-ClinicDB, Private, and ETIS-LaribPolypDB with four types of gastric infections such as ulcer, polyp, esophagitis, and bleeding. Using this database, proposed technique performs better as compared to existing methods and achieves an accuracy of 96.5%.

TI Deep Ranking for Person Re-Identification via Joint Representation

DE Person re-identification; deep convolutional neural network; learning to
   rank
AB This paper proposes a novel approach to person re-identification, a fundamental task in distributed multi-camera surveillance systems. Although a variety of powerful algorithms have been presented in the past few years, most of them usually focus on designing hand-crafted features and learning metrics either individually or sequentially. Different from previous works, we formulate a unified deep ranking framework that jointly tackles both of these key components to maximize their strengths. We start from the principle that the correct match of the probe image should be positioned in the top rank within the whole gallery set. An effective learning-to-rank algorithm is proposed to minimize the cost corresponding to the ranking disorders of the gallery. The ranking model is solved with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that builds the relation between input image pairs and their similarity scores through joint representation learning directly from raw image pixels. The proposed framework allows us to get rid of feature engineering and does not rely on any assumption. An extensive comparative evaluation is given, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art approaches, including both traditional and CNN-based methods on the challenging VIPeR, CUHK-01, and CAVIAR4REID datasets. In addition, our approach has better ability to generalize across datasets without fine-tuning.

AB In the early days, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) was studied with global features. Since 2003, image retrieval based on local descriptors (de facto SIFT) has been extensively studied for over a decade due to the advantage of SIFT in dealing with image transformations. Recently, image representations based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) have attracted increasing interest in the community and demonstrated impressive performance. Given this time of rapid evolution, this article provides a comprehensive survey of instance retrieval over the last decade. Two broad categories, SIFT-based and CNN-based methods, are presented. For the former, according to the codebook size, we organize the literature into using large/medium-sized/small codebooks. For the latter, we discuss three lines of methods, i.e., using pre-trained or fine-tuned CNN models, and hybrid methods. The first two perform a single-pass of an image to the network, while the last category employs a patch-based feature extraction scheme. This survey presents milestones in modern instance retrieval, reviews a broad selection of previous works in different categories, and provides insights on the connection between SIFT and CNN-based methods. After analyzing and comparing retrieval performance of different categories on several datasets, we discuss promising directions towards generic and specialized instance retrieval.

AB Breast cancer is among the leading cause of mortality among women in developing as well as under-developing countries. The detection and classification of breast cancer in the early stages of its development may allow patients to have proper treatment. In this article, we proposed a novel deep learning framework for the detection and classification of breast cancer in breast cytology images using the concept of transfer learning. In general, deep learning architectures are modeled to be problem specific and is performed in isolation. Contrary to classical learning paradigms, which develop and yield in isolation, transfer learning is aimed to utilize the gained knowledge during the solution of one problem into another related problem. In the proposed framework, features from images are extracted using pre-trained CNN architectures, namely, GoogLeNet, Visual Geometry Group Network (VGGNet) and Residual Networks (ResNet), which are fed into a fully connected layer for classification of malignant and benign cells using average pooling classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, experiments are performed on standard benchmark data sets. It has been observed that the proposed framework outclass all the other deep learning architectures in terms of accuracy in detection and classification of breast tumor in cytology images.

ID NATURAL-LANGUAGE WATERMARKING
AB In this paper, a linguistic steganalysis method based on two-level cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is proposed to improve the system's ability to detect stego texts, which are generated via synonym substitutions. The first-level network, sentence-level CNN, consists of one convolutional layer with multiple convolutional kernels in different window sizes, one pooling layer to deal with variable sentence lengths, and one fully connected layer with dropout as well as a softmax output, such that two final steganographic features are obtained for each sentence. The unmodified and modified sentences, along with their words, are represented in the form of pre-trained dense word embeddings, which serve as the input of the network. Sentence-level CNN provides the representation of a sentence, and can thus be utilized to predict whether a sentence is unmodified or has been modified by synonym substitutions. In the second level, a text-level CNN exploits the predicted representations of sentences obtained from the sentence-level CNN to determine whether the detected text is a stego text or cover text. Experimental results indicate that the proposed sentence-level CNN can effectively extract sentence features for sentence-level steganalysis tasks and reaches an average accuracy of 82.245%. Moreover, the proposed steganalysis method achieves greatly improved detection performance when distinguishing stego texts from cover texts.

AB Reservoir computing is a computational framework suited for temporal/sequential data processing. It is derived from several recurrent neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines. A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems, substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop next-generation machine learning systems.

AB Coronary artery disease (CAD) is caused due by the blockage of inner walls of coronary arteries by plaque. This constriction reduces the blood flow to the heart muscles resulting in myocardial infarction (MI). The electrocardiogram (ECG) is commonly used to screen the cardiac health. The ECG signals are nonstationary and nonlinear in nature whereby the transient disease indicators may appear randomly on the time scale. Therefore, the procedure to diagnose the abnormal beat is arduous, time consuming and prone to human errors. The automated diagnosis system overcomes these problems. In this study, convolutional neural network (CNN) structures comprising of four convolutional layers, four max pooling layers and three fully connected layers are proposed for the diagnosis of CAD using two and five seconds durations of ECG signal segments. Deep CNN is able to differentiate between normal and abnormal ECG with an accuracy of 94.95%, sensitivity of 93.72%, and specificity of 95.18% for Net 1 (two seconds) and accuracy of 95.11%, sensitivity of 91.13% and specificity of 95.88% for Net 2 (5 s). The proposed system can help the clinicians in their accurate and reliable decision making of CAD using ECG signals. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Software implementations of brain-inspired computing underlie many important computational tasks, from image processing to speech recognition, artificial intelligence and deep learning applications. Yet, unlike real neural tissue, traditional computing architectures physically separate the core computing functions of memory and processing, making fast, efficient and low-energy computing difficult to achieve. To overcome such limitations, an attractive alternative is to design hardware that mimics neurons and synapses. Such hardware, when connected in networks or neuromorphic systems, processes information in a way more analogous to brains. Here we present an all-optical version of such a neurosynaptic system, capable of supervised and unsupervised learning. We exploit wavelength division multiplexing techniques to implement a scalable circuit architecture for photonic neural networks, successfully demonstrating pattern recognition directly in the optical domain. Such photonic neurosynaptic networks promise access to the high speed and high bandwidth inherent to optical systems, thus enabling the direct processing of optical telecommunication and visual data.

The uncertainties stem from uncertain hydrodynamic parameters, modeling errors, and unknown forces due to the ocean currents in an underwater environment. An antidisturbance constrained controller is developed by designing a command governor and a disturbance observer. Specifically, the disturbance observer is developed to estimate the lumped disturbance composed of parametric model uncertainties, modeling errors, and unknown environmental forces. The command governor is designed for optimizing command signals in the receding horizon within the state and input constraints. The command governor is formulated as a quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem. To facilitate online implementations, a neurodynamic optimization method based on a one-layer recurrent neural network is employed for solving the quadratic optimization problem subject to inequality constraints with finite-time convergence. The efficacy of the proposed antidisturbance constrained control method for autonomous underwater vehicles is substantiated via simulations and comparisons.

AB In this paper, we regard edit propagation as a multi-class classification problem and deep neural network (DNN) is used to solve the problem. We design a shallow and fully convolutional DNN that can be trained end-to-end. To achieve this, our method uses combinations of low-level visual features, which are extracted from the input image, and spatial features, which are computed through transforming user interactions, as input of the DNN, which efficiently performs a joint learning of visual and spatial features. We then train the DNN on many of such combinations in order to build a DNN-based pixel-level classifier. Our DNN is also equipped with patch-by-patch training and whole image estimation, speeding up learning and inference. Finally, we improve classification accuracy of the DNN by employing a fully connected conditional random field. Experimental results show that our method can respond to user interactions well and generate precise results compared with the state-of-art edit propagation approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method on various applications.

AB Accurate and stable wind speed forecasting is essential for the planning, scheduling and control of wind energy generation and conversion in wind power industry. In this paper, a novel nonlinear hybrid model aiming at improving prediction performance of wind speed called LSTMDE-HELM is presented by using Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM), Hysteretic Extreme Learning Machine (HELM), Differential Evolution algorithm (DE), and nonlinear combined mechanism. First, to enhance the performance of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), a biological neural system property called hysteresis is embedded into neuron activation function of ELM. Second, as there isn't a clear knowledge to set the number of hidden layers in LSTM and neurons count in each hidden layer, DE is introduced to optimize these numbers by minimizing a weighted objective function for keeping balance between learning performance and model complexity. Finally, the forecasting results of each predictor in LSTMDE-HELM are aggregated by a novel nonlinear combined mechanism composed of LSTM network and also the DE is used to optimize this LSTM. The proposed nonlinear hybrid model is employed on the data gathered from a wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China. Two forecasting horizons i.e., ten-minute ahead (utmost short term) and one-hour ahead (short term) are adopted for experiments. Empirical results fully demonstrate the superiority of the proposed hybrid model compared with other models in terms of four performance indices and statistical tests.

AB Words are part of almost every marketplace interaction. Online reviews, customer service calls, press releases, marketing communications, and other interactions create a wealth of textual data. But how can marketers best use such data? This article provides an overview of automated textual analysis and details how it can be used to generate marketing insights. The authors discuss how text reflects qualities of the text producer (and the context in which the text was produced) and impacts the audience or text recipient. Next, they discuss how text can be a powerful tool both for prediction and for understanding (i.e., insights). Then, the authors overview methodologies and metrics used in text analysis, providing a set of guidelines and procedures. Finally, they further highlight some common metrics and challenges and discuss how researchers can address issues of internal and external validity. They conclude with a discussion of potential areas for future work. Along the way, the authors note how textual analysis can unite the tribes of marketing. While most marketing problems are interdisciplinary, the field is often fragmented. By involving skills and ideas from each of the subareas of marketing, text analysis has the potential to help unite the field with a common set of tools and approaches.

AB Text mining is a flexible technology that can be applied to numerous different tasks in biology and medicine. We present a system for extracting disease-gene associations from biomedical abstracts. The system consists of a highly efficient dictionary-based tagger for named entity recognition of human genes and diseases, which we combine with a scoring scheme that takes into account co-occurrences both within and between sentences. We show that this approach is able to extract half of all manually curated associations with a false positive rate of only 0.16%. Nonetheless, text mining should not stand alone, but be combined with other types of evidence. For this reason, we have developed the DISEASES resource, which integrates the results from text mining with manually curated disease-gene associations, cancer mutation data, and genome-wide association studies from existing databases. The DISEASES resource is accessible through a web interface at http://diseases.jensenlab.org/, where the text-mining software and all associations are also freely available for download.

SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
AB With the proliferation of ultrahigh-speed mobile networks and internet-connected devices, along with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)(1), the world is generating exponentially increasing amounts of data that need to be processed in a fast and efficient way. Highly parallelized, fast and scalable hardware is therefore becoming progressively more important(2). Here we demonstrate a computationally specific integrated photonic hardware accelerator (tensor core) that is capable of operating at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second (10(12) MAC operations per second or tera-MACs per second). The tensor core can be considered as the optical analogue of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It achieves parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change-material memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs(3)). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 gigahertz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates(3-5), ultralow-loss silicon nitride waveguides(6,7), and high-speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards full complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. Although we focus on convolutional processing, more generally our results indicate the potential of integrated photonics for parallel, fast, and efficient computational hardware in data-heavy AI applications such as autonomous driving, live video processing, and next-generation cloud computing services.

AB Clouds and cloud shadows heavily affect the quality of the remote sensing images and their application potential. Algorithms have been developed for detecting, removing, and reconstructing the shaded regions with the information from the neighboring pixels or multisource data. In this article, we propose an integrated cloud detection and removal framework using cascade convolutional neural networks, which provides accurate cloud and shadow masks and repaired images. First, a novel fully convolutional network (FCN), embedded with multiscale aggregation and the channel-attention mechanism, is developed for detecting clouds and shadows from a cloudy image. Second, another FCN, with the masks of the detected cloud and shadow, the cloudy image, and a temporal image as the input, is used for the cloud removal and missing-information reconstruction. The reconstruction is realized through a self-training strategy that is designed to learn the mapping between the clean-pixel pairs of the bitemporal images, which bypasses the high demand of manual labels. Experiments showed that our proposed framework can simultaneously detect and remove the clouds and shadows from the images and the detection accuracy surpassed several recent cloud-detection methods; the effects of image restoring outperform the mainstream methods in every indicator by a large margin. The data set used for cloud detection and removal is made open.

AB We present VoxelMorph, a fast learning-based framework for deformable, pairwise medical image registration. Traditional registration methods optimize an objective function for each pair of images, which can be time-consuming for large datasets or rich deformation models. In contrast to this approach and building on recent learning-based methods, we formulate registration as a function that maps an input image pair to a deformation field that aligns these images. We parameterize the function via a convolutional neural network and optimize the parameters of the neural network on a set of images. Given a new pair of scans, VoxelMorph rapidly computes a deformation field by directly evaluating the function. In this paper, we explore two different training strategies. In the first (unsupervised) setting, we train the model to maximize standard image matching objective functions that are based on the image intensities. In the second setting, we leverage auxiliary segmentations available in the training data. We demonstrate that the unsupervised model's accuracy is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods while operating orders of magnitude faster. We also show that VoxelMorph trained with auxiliary data improves registration accuracy at test time and evaluate the effect of training set size on registration. Our method promises to speed up medical image analysis and processing pipelines while facilitating novel directions in learning-based registration and its applications.

AB In this paper, an adaptive neural network (NN) control problem is investigated for discrete-time nonlinear systems with input saturation. Radial-basis-function (RBF) NNs, including critic NNs and action NNs, are employed to approximate the utility functions and system uncertainties, respectively. In the previous works, a gradient descent scheme is applied to update weight vectors, which may lead to local optimal problem. To circumvent this problem, a multigradient recursive (MGR) reinforcement learning scheme is proposed, which utilizes both the current gradient and the past gradients. As a consequence, the MGR scheme not only eliminates the local optimal problem but also guarantees faster convergence rate than the gradient descent scheme. Moreover, the constraint of actuator input saturation is considered. The closed-loop system stability is developed by using the Lyapunov stability theory, and it is proved that all the signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is further validated via some simulation results.

AB With the increasing ability to routinely and rapidly digitize whole slide images with slide scanners, there has been interest in developing computerized image analysis algorithms for automated detection of disease extent from digital pathology images. The manual identification of presence and extent of breast cancer by a pathologist is critical for patient management for tumor staging and assessing treatment response. However, this process is tedious and subject to inter- and intra-reader variability. For computerized methods to be useful as decision support tools, they need to be resilient to data acquired from different sources, different staining and cutting protocols and different scanners. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of a deep learning-based method to automatically identify the extent of invasive tumor on digitized images. Here, we present a new method that employs a convolutional neural network for detecting presence of invasive tumor on whole slide images. Our approach involves training the classifier on nearly 400 exemplars from multiple different sites, and scanners, and then independently validating on almost 200 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our approach yielded a Dice coefficient of 75.86%, a positive predictive value of 71.62% and a negative predictive value of 96.77% in terms of pixel-by-pixel evaluation compared to manually annotated regions of invasive ductal carcinoma.

TI Channel State Information Prediction for 5G Wireless Communications: A

DE Channel state estimation; 5G wireless communications; deep learning
ID OPTIMIZATION; RELAY
AB Channel state information (CSI) estimation is one of the most fundamental problems in wireless communication systems. Various methods, so far, have been developed to conduct CSI estimation. However, they usually require high computational complexity, which makes them unsuitable for 5G wireless communications due to employing many new techniques (e.g., massive MIMO, OFDM, and millimeter-Wave (mmWave)). In this paper, we propose an efficient online CSI prediction scheme, called OCEAN, for predicting CSI from historical data in 5G wireless communication systems. Specifically, we first identify several important features affecting the CSI of a radio link and a data sample consists of the information of the features and the CSI. We then design a learning framework that is an integration of a CNN (convolutional neural network) and a long short term with memory (LSTM) network. We also further develop an offline-online two-step training mechanism, enabling the prediction results to be more stable when applying it to practical 5G wireless communication systems. To validate OCEAN's efficacy, we consider four typical case studies, and conduct extensive experiments in the four scenarios, i.e., two outdoor and two indoor scenarios. The experiment results show that OCEAN not only obtains the predicted CSI values very quickly but also achieves highly accurate CSI prediction with up to 2.650-3.457 percent average difference ratio (ADR) between the predicted and measured CSI.

AB Since December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused world-wide turmoil in a short period of time, and the infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is spreading rapidly. AI-driven tools are used to identify Coronavirus outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread, where imaging techniques are widely used, such as CT scans and chest X-rays (CXRs). In this paper, motivated by the fact that X-ray imaging systems are more prevalent and cheaper than CT scan systems, a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which we call Truncated Inception Net, is proposed to screen COVID-19 positive CXRs from other non-COVID and/or healthy cases. To validate our proposal, six different types of datasets were employed by taking the following CXRs: COVID-19 positive, Pneumonia positive, Tuberculosis positive, and healthy cases into account. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 99.96% (AUC of 1.0) in classifying COVID-19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia and healthy cases. Similarly, it achieved an accuracy of 99.92% (AUC of 0.99) in classifying COVID-19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and healthy CXRs. To the best of our knowledge, as of now, the achieved results outperform the existing AI-driven tools for screening COVID-19 using the acquired CXRs, and proves the viability of using the proposed Truncated Inception Net as a screening tool.

AB Coronavirus causes a wide variety of respiratory infections and it is an RNA-type virus that can infect both humans and animal species. It often causes pneumonia in humans. Artificial intelligence models have been helpful for successful analyses in the biomedical field. In this study, Coronavirus was detected using a deep learning model, which is a sub-branch of artificial intelligence. Our dataset consists of three classes namely: coronavirus, pneumonia, and normal X-ray imagery. In this study, the data classes were restructured using the Fuzzy Color technique as a preprocessing step and the images that were structured with the original images were stacked. In the next step, the stacked dataset was trained with deep learning models (MobileNetV2, SqueezeNet) and the feature sets obtained by the models were processed using the Social Mimic optimization method. Thereafter, efficient features were combined and classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The overall classification rate obtained with the proposed approach was 99.27%. With the proposed approach in this study, it is evident that the model can efficiently contribute to the detection of COVID-19 disease.

AB Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors together provide the most widely accessible medium-to-high spatial resolution multispectral data for a wide range of applications, such as vegetation phenology identification, crop yield estimation, and forest disturbance detection. Improved timely and accurate observations of the Earth's surface and dynamics are expected from the synergistic use of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, which entails coordinating the spatial resolution gap between Landsat (30 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m or 20 m) images. However, widely used data fusion techniques may not fulfil community's needs for generating a temporally dense reflectance product at 10 m spatial resolution from combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 images because of their inherent algorithmic weaknesses. Inspired by the recent advances in deep learning, this study developed an extended super-resolution convolutional neural network (ESRCNN) to a data fusion framework, specifically for blending Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the deep learning-based fusion algorithm in yielding a consistent and comparable dataset at 10 m from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Further accuracy assessments revealed that the performance of the fusion network was influenced by both the number of input auxiliary Sentinel-2 images and temporal interval (i.e., difference in image acquisition dates) between auxiliary Sentinel-2 images and the target Landsat-8 image. Compared to the benchmark algorithm, area-to-point regression kriging (ATKPK), the deep learning-based fusion framework proved better in the quantitative assessment in terms of RMSE (root mean square error), correlation coefficient (CC), universal image quality index (UIQI), relative global-dimensional synthesis error (ERGAS), and spectral angle mapper (SAM). ESRCNN better preserved the reflectance distribution as the original image compared to ATPRK, resulting in an improved image quality. Overall, the developed data fusion network that blends Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images has the potential to help generate continuous reflectance observations of higher temporal frequency than that can be obtained from a single Landsat-like sensor.

AB Machine learning, a collection of data-analytical techniques aimed at building predictive models from multi-dimensional datasets, is becoming integral to modern biological research. By enabling one to generate models that learn from large datasets and make predictions on likely outcomes, machine learning can be used to study complex cellular systems such as biological networks. Here, we provide a primer on machine learning for life scientists, including an introduction to deep learning. We discuss opportunities and challenges at the intersection of machine learning and network biology, which could impact disease biology, drug discovery, microbiome research, and synthetic biology.

AB The capacity to recognize faces under varied poses is a fundamental human ability that presents a unique challenge for computer vision systems. Compared to frontal face recognition, which has been intensively studied and has gradually matured in the past few decades, Pose-Invariant Face Recognition (PIFR) remains a largely unsolved problem. However, PIFR is crucial to realizing the full potential of face recognition for real-world applications, since face recognition is intrinsically a passive biometric technology for recognizing uncooperative subjects. In this article, we discuss the inherent difficulties in PIFR and present a comprehensive review of established techniques. Existing PIFR methods can be grouped into four categories, that is, pose-robust feature extraction approaches, multiview subspace learning approaches, face synthesis approaches, and hybrid approaches. The motivations, strategies, pros/cons, and performance of representative approaches are described and compared. Moreover, promising directions for future research are discussed.

AB Fuzzy rough theory can describe real-world situations in a mathematically effective and interpretable way, while evolutionary neural networks can be utilized to solve complex problems. Combining them with these complementary capabilities may lead to evolutionary fuzzy rough neural network with the interpretability and prediction capability. In this article, we propose modifications to the existing models of fuzzy rough neural network and then develop a powerful evolutionary framework for fuzzy rough neural networks by inheriting the merits of both the aforementioned systems. We first introduce rough neurons and enhance the consequence nodes, and further integrate the interval type-2 fuzzy set into the existing fuzzy rough neural network model. Thus, several modified fuzzy rough neural network models are proposed. While simultaneously considering the objectives of prediction precision and network simplicity, each model is transformed into a multiobjective optimization problem by encoding the structure, membership functions, and the parameters of the network. To solve these optimization problems, distributed parallel multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are proposed. We enhance the optimization processes with several measures including optimizer replacement and parameter adaption. In the distributed parallel environment, the tedious and time-consuming neural network optimization can be alleviated by numerous computational resources, significantly reducing the computational time. Through experimental verification on complex stock time series prediction tasks, the proposed optimization algorithms and the modified fuzzy rough neural network models exhibit significant improvements the existing fuzzy rough neural network and the long short-term memory network.

   Cancer prediction
AB Background and Objective: Cancer is a complex worldwide health problem associated with high mortality. With the rapid development of the high-throughput sequencing technology and the application of various machine learning methods that have emerged in recent years, progress in cancer prediction has been increasingly made based on gene expression, providing insight into effective and accurate treatment decision making. Thus, developing machine learning methods, which can successfully distinguish cancer patients from healthy persons, is of great current interest. However, among the classification methods applied to cancer prediction so far, no one method outperforms all the others.
   Methods: In this paper, we demonstrate a new strategy, which applies deep learning to an ensemble approach that incorporates multiple different machine learning models. We supply informative gene data selected by differential gene expression analysis to five different classification models. Then, a deep learning method is employed to ensemble the outputs of the five classifiers.
   Results: The proposed deep learning-based multi-model ensemble method was tested on three public RNA-seq data sets of three kinds of cancers, Lung Adenocarcinoma, Stomach Adenocarcinoma and Breast Invasive Carcinoma. The test results indicate that it increases the prediction accuracy of cancer for all the tested RNA-seq data sets as compared to using a single classifier or the majority voting algorithm.
   Conclusions: By taking full advantage of different classifiers, the proposed deep learning-based multi-model ensemble method is shown to be accurate and effective for cancer prediction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the introduction of consumer light field cameras, light field imaging has recently become widespread. However, there is an inherent trade-off between the angular and spatial resolution, and thus, these cameras often sparsely sample in either spatial or angular domain. In this paper, we use machine learning to mitigate this trade-off. Specifically, we propose a novel learning-based approach to synthesize new views from a sparse set of input views. We build upon existing view synthesis techniques and break down the process into disparity and color estimation components. We use two sequential convolutional neural networks to model these two components and train both networks simultaneously by minimizing the error between the synthesized and ground truth images. We show the performance of our approach using only four corner sub-aperture views from the light fields captured by the Lytro Illum camera. Experimental results show that our approach synthesizes high-quality images that are superior to the state-of-the-art techniques on a variety of challenging real-world scenes. We believe our method could potentially decrease the required angular resolution of consumer light field cameras, which allows their spatial resolution to increase.

AB Since its introduction, the reward prediction error theory of dopamine has explained a wealth of empirical phenomena, providing a unifying framework for understanding the representation of reward and value in the brain(1-3). According to the now canonical theory, reward predictions are represented as a single scalar quantity, which supports learning about the expectation, or mean, of stochastic outcomes. Here we propose an account of dopamine-based reinforcement learning inspired by recent artificial intelligence research on distributional reinforcement learning(4-6). We hypothesized that the brain represents possible future rewards not as a single mean, but instead as a probability distribution, effectively representing multiple future outcomes simultaneously and in parallel. This idea implies a set of empirical predictions, which we tested using single-unit recordings from mouse ventral tegmental area. Our findings provide strong evidence for a neural realization of distributional reinforcement learning.
   Analyses of single-cell recordings from mouse ventral tegmental area are consistent with a model of reinforcement learning in which the brain represents possible future rewards not as a single mean of stochastic outcomes, as in the canonical model, but instead as a probability distribution.

ID DEEP
AB Hashing has been an important and effective technology in image retrieval due to its computational efficiency and fast search speed. The traditional hashing methods usually learn hash functions to obtain binary codes by exploiting hand-crafted features, which cannot optimally represent the information of the sample. Recently, deep learning methods can achieve better performance, since deep learning architectures can learn more effective image representation features. However, these methods only use semantic features to generate hash codes by shallow projection but ignore texture details. In this paper, we proposed a novel hashing method, namely hierarchical recurrent neural hashing (HRNH), to exploit hierarchical recurrent neural network to generate effective hash codes. There are three contributions of this paper. First, a deep hashing method is proposed to extensively exploit both spatial details and semantic information, in which, we leverage hierarchical convolutional features to construct image pyramid representation. Second, our proposed deep network can exploit directly convolutional feature maps as input to preserve the spatial structure of convolutional feature maps. Finally, we propose a new loss function that considers the quantization error of binarizing the continuous embeddings into the discrete binary codes, and simultaneously maintains the semantic similarity and balanceable property of hash codes. Experimental results on four widely used data sets demonstrate that the proposed HRNH can achieve superior performance over other state-of-the-art hashing methods.

AB Machine learning is currently the most active interdisciplinary field having numerous applications; additionally, machine-learning techniques are used to research quantum many-body problems. In this study, we first propose neural network quantum states (NNQSs) with general input observables and explore a few related properties, such as the tensor product and local unitary operation. Second, we determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the representability of a general graph state using normalized NNQS. Finally, to quantify the approximation degree of a given pure state, we de fi ne the best approximation degree using normalized NNQSs. Furthermore, we observe that some N-qubit states can be represented by a normalized NNQS, such as separable pure states, Bell states and GHZ states.

TI Automated Triaging of Adult Chest Radiographs with Deep Artificial

LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSIFICATION; INTELLIGENCE
AB Purpose: To develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI) system, based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for automated real- time triaging of adult chest radiographs on the basis of the urgency of imaging appearances.
   Materials and Methods: An AI system was developed by using 470 388 fully anonymized institutional adult chest radiographs acquired from 2007 to 2017. The free- text radiology reports were preprocessed by using an in- house natural language processing (NLP) system modeling radiologic language. The NLP system analyzed the free- text report to prioritize each radiograph as critical, urgent, nonurgent, or normal. An AI system for computer vision using an ensemble of two deep CNNs was then trained by using labeled radiographs to predict the clinical priority from radiologic appearances only. The system's performance in radiograph prioritization was tested in a simulation by using an independent set of 15 887 radiographs. Prediction performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were also determined. Nonparametric testing of the improvement in time to final report was determined at a nominal significance level of 5%.
   Results: Normal chest radiographs were detected by our AI system with a sensitivity of 71%, specificity of 95%, PPV of 73%, and NPV of 94%. The average reporting delay was reduced from 11.2 to 2.7 days for critical imaging findings (P < .001) and from 7.6 to 4.1 days for urgent imaging findings (P < .001) in the simulation compared with historical data.
   Conclusion: Automated real- time triaging of adult chest radiographs with use of an artificial intelligence system is feasible, with clinically acceptable performance. (C) RSNA, 2019

AB Accurate wind speed forecasting is critical to the exploitation and utilization of wind energy. In this paper, a novel wind speed multi-step prediction model is designed based on the SSA (Singular Spectrum Analysis), EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) and CNNSVM (Convolutional Support Vector Machine). In the SSA-EMD-CNNSVM model, the SSA is used to reduce the noise and extract the trend information of the original wind speed data; the EMD is used to extract the fluctuation features of the wind speed data and decompose the wind speed time series into a number of sub-layers; and the CNNSVM is used to predict each of the wind speed sub-layers. To investigate the prediction performance of the proposed model, some models are used as the comparison models, including the SVM model, CNNSVM model, EMD-BP model, EMD-RBF model and EMD-Elman model. According to the prediction results of the four experiments, it can be found that the proposed model can have significantly better performance than the seven comparison models from 1-step to 3-step wind speed predictions with the MAPE of 42.85% average performance promotion, MAE of 39.21% average performance promotion, RMSE of 39.25% average performance promotion.

AB The use of artificial intelligence, and the deep-learning subtype in particular, has been enabled by the use of labeled big data, along with markedly enhanced computing power and cloud storage, across all sectors. In medicine, this is beginning to have an impact at three levels: for clinicians, predominantly via rapid, accurate image interpretation; for health systems, by improving workflow and the potential for reducing medical errors; and for patients, by enabling them to process their own data to promote health. The current limitations, including bias, privacy and security, and lack of transparency, along with the future directions of these applications will be discussed in this article. Over time, marked improvements in accuracy, productivity, and workflow will likely be actualized, but whether that will be used to improve the patient-doctor relationship or facilitate its erosion remains to be seen.

ID SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; WEB SERVER; DNA; IDENTIFICATION; LOCATIONS; RNA
AB Protein subcellular localization (PSL), as one of the most critical characteristics of human cells, plays an important role for understanding specific functions and biological processes in cells. Accurate prediction of protein subcellular localization is a fundamental and challenging problem, for which machine learning algorithms have been widely used. Traditionally, the performance of PSL prediction highly depends on handcrafted feature descriptors to represent proteins. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a hot research topic in the field of machine learning, achieving outstanding success in learning high-level latent features within data samples. In this paper, to accurately predict protein subcellular locations, we propose a deep learning based predictor called DeepPSL by using Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) networks. In this predictor, we automatically learn high-level and abstract feature representations of proteins by exploring non-linear relations among diverse subcellular locations, addressing the problem of the need of handcrafted feature representations. Experimental results evaluated with three-fold cross validation show that the proposed DeepPSL outperforms traditional machine learning based methods. It is expected that DeepPSL, as the first predictor in the field of PSL prediction, has great potential to be a powerful computational method complementary to existing tools. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Time-varying formation control problems for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm systems with switching interaction topologies are studied. Necessary and sufficient conditions for UAV swarm systems with switching interaction topologies to achieve predefined time-varying formations are proposed. Based on the common Lyapunov functional approach and algebraic Riccati equation technique, an approach to design the formation protocol is presented. An explicit expression of the formation reference function is derived to describe the macroscopic movement of the whole UAV formation. A quadrotor formation platform consisting of four quadrotors is introduced. Outdoor experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper addresses the improvement of tracking of the maximum power point upon the variations of the environmental conditions and hence improving photovoltaic efficiency. Rather than the traditional methods of maximum power point tracking, artificial intelligence is utilized to design a high-performance maximum power point tracking control system. In this paper, two artificial intelligence-based maximum power point tracking systems are proposed for grid-connected photovoltaic units. The first design is based on an optimized fuzzy logic control using genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization for the maximum power point tracking system. In turn, the second design depends on the genetic algorithm-based artificial neural network. Each of the two artificial intelligence-based systems has its privileged response according to the solar radiation and temperature levels. Then, a novel combination of the two designs is introduced to maximize the efficiency of the maximum power point tracking system. The novelty of this paper is to employ the metaheuristic optimization technique with the well-known artificial intelligence techniques to provide a better tracking system to be used to harvest the maximum possible power from photovoltaic (PV) arrays. To affirm the efficiency of the proposed tracking systems, their simulation results are compared with some conventional tracking methods from the literature under different conditions. The findings emphasize their superiority in terms of tracking speed and output DC power, which also improve photovoltaic system efficiency.

AB After the boom and bust of cryptocurrencies' prices in recent years, Bitcoin has been increasingly regarded as an investment asset. Because of its highly volatile nature, there is a need for good predictions on which to base investment decisions. Although existing studies have leveraged machine learning for more accurate Bitcoin price prediction, few have focused on the feasibility of applying different modeling techniques to samples with different data structures and dimensional features. To predict Bitcoin price at different frequencies using machine learning techniques, we first classify Bitcoin price by daily price and high-frequency price. A set of high-dimension features including property and network, trading and market, attention and gold spot price are used for Bitcoin daily price prediction, while the basic trading features acquired from a cryptocurrency exchange are used for 5-minute interval price prediction. Statistical methods including Logistic Regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis for Bitcoin daily price prediction with high-dimensional features achieve an accuracy of 66%, outperforming more complicated machine learning algorithms. Compared with benchmark results for daily price prediction, we achieve a better performance, with the highest accuracies of the statistical methods and machine learning algorithms of 66% and 65.3%, respectively. Machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Long Short-term Memory for Bitcoin 5-minute interval price prediction are superior to statistical methods, with accuracy reaching 67.2%. Our investigation of Bitcoin price prediction can be considered a pilot study of the importance of the sample dimension in machine learning techniques. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that players have perfect information. Poker, the quintessential game of imperfect information, is a long-standing challenge problem in artificial intelligence. We introduce DeepStack, an algorithm for imperfect-information settings. It combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to focus computation on the relevant decision, and a formof intuition that is automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving 44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated, with statistical significance, professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em. The approach is theoretically sound and is shown to produce strategies that are more difficult to exploit than prior approaches.

AB Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to assign each hyperspectral pixel with a proper land-cover label. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown superior performance. To identify the land-cover label, CNN-based methods exploit the adjacent pixels as an input HSI cube, which simultaneously contains spectral signatures and spatial information. However, at the edge of each land-cover area, an HSI cube often contains several pixels whose land-cover labels are different from that of the center pixel. These pixels, named interfering pixels, will weaken the discrimination of spectral-spatial features and reduce classification accuracy. In this article, a spectral-spatial attention network (SSAN) is proposed to capture discriminative spectral-spatial features from attention areas of HSI cubes. First, a simple spectral-spatial network (SSN) is built to extract spectral-spatial features from HSI cubes. The SSN is composed of a spectral module and a spatial module. Each module consists of only a few 3-D convolution and activation operations, which make the proposed method easy to converge with a small number of training samples. Second, an attention module is introduced to suppress the effects of interfering pixels. The attention module is embedded into the SSN to obtain the SSAN. The experiments on several public HSI databases demonstrate that the proposed SSAN outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.

AB In this paper, a generalized formulation for intelligent energy management of a microgrid is proposed using artificial intelligence techniques jointly with linear-programming-based multiobjective optimization. The proposed multiobjective intelligent energy management aims to minimize the operation cost and the environmental impact of a microgrid, taking into account its preoperational variables as future availability of renewable energies and load demand (LD). An artificial neural network ensemble is developed to predict 24-h-ahead photovoltaic generation and 1-h-ahead wind power generation and LD. The proposed machine learning is characterized by enhanced learning model and generalization capability. The efficiency of the microgrid operation strongly depends on the battery scheduling process, which cannot be achieved through conventional optimization formulation. In this paper, a fuzzy logic expert system is used for battery scheduling. The proposed approach can handle uncertainties regarding to the fuzzy environment of the overall microgrid operation and the uncertainty related to the forecasted parameters. The results show considerable minimization on operation cost and emission level compared to literature microgrid energy management approaches based on opportunity charging and Heuristic Flowchart (HF) battery management.

ID CLASSIFICATION; VALIDITY
AB Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal disorder. OA diagnosis is currently conducted by assessing symptoms and evaluating plain radiographs, but this process suffers from subjectivity. In this study, we present a new transparent computer-aided diagnosis method based on the Deep Siamese Convolutional Neural Network to automatically score knee OA severity according to the Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale. We trained our method using the data solely from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study and validated it on randomly selected 3,000 subjects (5,960 knees) from Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset. Our method yielded a quadratic Kappa coefficient of 0.83 and average multiclass accuracy of 66.71% compared to the annotations given by a committee of clinical experts. Here, we also report a radiological OA diagnosis area under the ROC curve of 0.93. Besides this, we present attention maps highlighting the radiological features affecting the network decision. Such information makes the decision process transparent for the practitioner, which builds better trust toward automatic methods. We believe that our model is useful for clinical decision making and for OA research; therefore, we openly release our training codes and the data set created in this study.

SO PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG
LA English
DT Article
AB Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly gaining importance as a valuable methodical tool for psychological research. The greatest benefit of using VR is generating rich, complex and vivid, but still highly controllable settings. As VR has been found to elicit lifelike psychophysiological and emotional responses, we examined by means of a height exposure whether VR resembles physical reality to the necessary degree to constitute a suitable framework for investigating real-life behavior in a controlled experimental context. As hypothesized, participants behaved in VR exactly as would be appropriate in a real environment: Being exposed to great height, participants walked significantly slower across a virtual steel girder construction protruding from a high-rise building as compared to participants who traversed the very same construction on the ground level. In the height condition, this realistic behavior could be predicted on basis of the participants' trait anxiety. Aligned with the behavioral responses, they showed realistic psychophysiological responses, i.e., an elevated heart rate when exposed to height. Interestingly, participants of the height condition reported a greater sense of presence, which indicates that emotions have an elevating effect on presence. As a conclusion, our findings provide further evidence that VR evokes lifelike responses at both behavioral and psychophysiological level and therefore increases ecological validity of psychological experiments.

AB Machine learning, one of today's most rapidly growing interdisciplinary fields, promises an unprecedented perspective for solving intricate quantum many-body problems. Understanding the physical aspects of the representative artificial neural-network states has recently become highly desirable in the applications of machine-learning techniques to quantum many-body physics. In this paper, we explore the data structures that encode the physical features in the network states by studying the quantum entanglement properties, with a focus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. We prove that the entanglement entropy of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary dimensions and bipartition geometry. For long-range RBM states, we show by using an exact construction that such states could exhibit volume-law entanglement, implying a notable capability of RBM in representing quantum states with massive entanglement. Strikingly, the neural-network representation for these states is remarkably efficient, in the sense that the number of nonzero parameters scales only linearly with the system size. We further examine the entanglement properties of generic RBM states by randomly sampling the weight parameters of the RBM. We find that their averaged entanglement entropy obeys volume-law scaling, and the meantime strongly deviates from the Page entropy of the completely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no universal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type level statistics. Using reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that RBM is capable of finding the ground state (with power-law entanglement) of a model Hamiltonian with a long-range interaction. In addition, we show, through a concrete example of the one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological cluster states, that the RBM representation may also be used as a tool to analytically compute the entanglement spectrum. Our results uncover the unparalleled power of artificial neural networks in representing quantum many-body states regardless of how much entanglement they possess, which paves a novel way to bridge computer-science-based machine-learning techniques to outstanding quantum condensed-matter physics problems.

AB Sparse coding represents a signal sparsely by using an overcomplete dictionary, and obtains promising performance in practical computer vision applications, especially for signal restoration tasks such as image denoising and image inpainting. In recent years, many discriminative sparse coding algorithms have been developed for classification problems, but they cannot naturally handle visual data represented by multiview features. In addition, existing sparse coding algorithms use graph Laplacian to model the local geometry of the data distribution. It has been identified that Laplacian regularization biases the solution towards a constant function which possibly leads to poor extrapolating power. In this paper, we present multiview Hessian discriminative sparse coding (mHDSC) which seamlessly integrates Hessian regularization with discriminative sparse coding for multiview learning problems. In particular, mHDSC exploits Hessian regularization to steer the solution which varies smoothly along geodesics in the manifold, and treats the label information as an additional view of feature for incorporating the discriminative power for image annotation. We conduct extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC'07 dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of mHDSC for image annotation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The highest accuracy object detectors to date are based on a two-stage approach popularized by R-CNN, where a classifier is applied to a sparse set of candidate object locations. In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB In wireless sensor networks, utilizing the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile data collector for the sensor nodes (SNs) is an energy-efficient technique to prolong the network lifetime. In this letter, considering a general fading channel model for the SN-UAV links, we jointly optimize the SNs' wakeup schedule and UAV's trajectory to minimize the maximum energy consumption of all SNs, while ensuring that the required amount of data is collected reliably from each SN. We formulate our design as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. By applying the successive convex optimization technique, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to find a sub-optimal solution. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant network energy saving as compared to benchmark schemes.

AB Virtual reality (VR) has made its way into mainstream psychological research in the last two decades. This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application of VR is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in VR, which describes the user's sense of being in a VR environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution model of presence is suggested as a first step toward an integrative framework for emotion research in VR. Gaps in the current literature and future directions are outlined.

AB In this paper, we propose a Stack Auto-encoder (SAE)-Driven and Semi-Supervised (SSL)-Based Deep Neural Network (DNN) to extract buildings from relatively low-cost satellite near infrared images. The novelty of our scheme is that we employ only an extremely small portion of labeled data for training the deep model which constitutes less than 0.08% of the total data. This way, we significantly reduce the manual effort needed to complete an annotation process, and thus the time required for creating a reliable labeled dataset. On the contrary, we apply novel semi-supervised techniques to estimate soft labels (targets) of the vast amount of existing unlabeled data and then we utilize these soft estimates to improve model training. Overall, four SSL schemes are employed, the Anchor Graph, the Safe Semi-Supervised Regression (SAFER), the Squared-loss Mutual Information Regularization (SMIR), and an equal importance Weighted Average of them (WeiAve). To retain only the most meaning information of the input data, labeled and unlabeled ones, we also employ a Stack Autoencoder (SAE) trained under an unsupervised manner. This way, we handle noise in the input signals, attributed to dimensionality redundancy, without sacrificing meaningful information. Experimental results on the benchmarked dataset of Vaihingen city in Germany indicate that our approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods in the field using the same type of color orthoimages, though the fact that a limited dataset is utilized (10 times less data or better, compared to other approaches), while our performance is close to the one achieved by high expensive and much more precise input information like the one derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors. In addition, the proposed approach can be easily expanded to handle any number of classes, including buildings, vegetation, and ground.

AB It is generally difficult to obtain a large number of labeled samples (i.e., samples with known fault types) of rolling bearings installed on large-scale mechanical equipment under current working conditions, which leads to the low accuracy of fault diagnosis for current testing samples using traditional machine learning algorithms. On account of this, a novel transfer learning method termed as deep convolution domain-adversarial transfer learning (DCDATL) is proposed for rolling bearing fault diagnosis in this paper. In the proposed DCDATL, a new deep convolution residual feature extractor is constructed to extract high-level features, which can avoid gradient problems such as gradient disappearance and gradient divergence during training DCDATL, thus improving the convergence and non-linear approximation ability of DCDATL. At the same time, the joint distribution of labeled samples in auxiliary domain and unlabeled samples in target domain is creatively used for domain-adversarial training, which can enhance the adaptability of samples in auxiliary domain to target domain and improve the transfer performance of DCDATL. Moreover, the strategy based on minimizing the joint distribution domain-adversarial total loss function of DCDATL is innovatively presented to improve the fault classification accuracy after high-level feature transfer. The above advantages of DCDATL make it feasible to perform high-precision fault diagnosis on current testing samples by using the historical labeled samples in auxiliary domain when there are no labeled samples in target domain. The fault diagnosis examples of rolling bearings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Background and Objective: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus never identified before in humans. This virus causes respiratory disease (for instance, flu) with symptoms such as cough, fever and, in severe cases, pneumonia. The test to detect the presence of this virus in humans is performed on sputum or blood samples and the outcome is generally available within a few hours or, at most, days. Analysing biomedical imaging the patient shows signs of pneumonia. In this paper, with the aim of providing a fully automatic and faster diagnosis, we propose the adoption of deep learning for COVID-19 detection from X-rays.
   Method: In particular, we propose an approach composed by three phases: the first one to detect if in a chest X-ray there is the presence of a pneumonia. The second one to discern between COVID-19 and pneumonia. The last step is aimed to localise the areas in the X-ray symptomatic of the COVID-19 presence.
   Results and Conclusion: Experimental analysis on 6,523 chest X-rays belonging to different institutions demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with an average time for COVID-19 detection of approximately 2.5 seconds and an average accuracy equal to 0.97.

AB Wavelet transform (WT), as a data preprocessing algorithm, has been widely applied in electricity price forecasting. However, this deterministic-based algorithm does not present stable performance owing to the experiential selection of its orders and layers. For determining the selection of WTs orders and layers in U.S. electricity prices forecasting, this paper designs a crossover experiment with 240 schemes of WT parameter selection and forecasts each scheme with stacked autoencoder (SAE) and long short-term memory (LSTM), generating a novel hybrid model WT-SAE-LSTM. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other AI models, such as back propagation neural network et al., in forecasting accuracy. The best performance of WT-SAE-LSTM in residential, commercial, and industrial electricity price cases obtained by five order four layers, five order four layers, and four order seven layers, where the MAPE is 0.8606%, 0.4719%, and 0.4956%, respectively. Additionally, the difference between the proposed forecasting model and the forecasting result of Energy Information Administration (U.S.) is small. This paper determines the optimal orders and layers of WT in U.S. electricity prices forecasting, which provides an effective reference for the application of WT in other forecasting scenarios and for electricity market participants.

AB Fault diagnosis plays an important role in modern industry. With the development of smart manufacturing, the data-driven fault diagnosis becomes hot. However, traditional methods have two shortcomings: 1) their performances depend on the good design of handcrafted features of data, but it is difficult to predesign these features and 2) they work well under a general assumption: the training data and testing data should be drawn from the same distribution, but this assumption fails in many engineering applications. Since deep learning (DL) can extract the hierarchical representation features of raw data, and transfer learning provides a good way to perform a learning task on the different but related distribution datasets, deep transfer learning (DTL) has been developed for fault diagnosis. In this paper, a new DTL method is proposed. It uses a three-layer sparse auto-encoder to extract the features of raw data, and applies the maximum mean discrepancy term to minimizing the discrepancy penalty between the features from training data and testing data. The proposed DTL is tested on the famous motor bearing dataset from the Case Western Reserve University. The results show a good improvement, and DTL achieves higher prediction accuracies on most experiments than DL. The prediction accuracy of DTL, which is as high as 99.82%, is better than the results of other algorithms, including deep belief network, sparse filter, artificial neural network, support vector machine and some other traditional methods. What is more, two additional analytical experiments are conducted. The results show that a good unlabeled third dataset may be helpful to DTL, and a good linear relationship between the final prediction accuracies and their standard deviations have been observed.

AB Neural networks are becoming central in several areas of computer vision and image processing and different architectures have been proposed to solve specific problems. The impact of the loss layer of neural networks, however, has not received much attention in the context of image processing: the default and virtually only choice is l(2). In this paper, we bring attention to alternative choices for image restoration. In particular, we show the importance of perceptually-motivated losses when the resulting image is to be evaluated by a human observer. We compare the performance of several losses, and propose a novel, differentiable error function. We show that the quality of the results improves significantly with better loss functions, even when the network architecture is left unchanged.

AB The abundance of accessible educational data, supported by the technology-enhanced learning platforms, provides opportunities to mine learning behavior of students, addressing their issues, optimizing the educational environment, and enabling data-driven decision making. Virtual learning environments complement the learning analytics paradigm by effectively providing datasets for analysing and reporting the learning process of students and its reflection and contribution in their respective performances. This study deploys a deep artificial neural network on a set of unique handcrafted features, extracted from the virtual learning environments clickstream data, to predict at-risk students providing measures for early intervention of such cases. The results show the proposed model to achieve a classification accuracy of 84%-93%. We show that a deep artificial neural network outperforms the baseline logistic regression and support vector machine models. While logistic regression achieves an accuracy of 79.82%-85.60%, the support vector machine achieves 79.95%-89.14%. Aligned with the existing studies - our findings demonstrate the inclusion of legacy data and assessment-related data to impact the model significantly. Students interested in accessing the content of the previous lectures are observed to demonstrate better performance. The study intends to assist institutes in formulating a necessary framework for pedagogical support, facilitating higher education decision-making process towards sustainable education.

AB Selective ensemble is a learning paradigm that follows an "overproduce and choose" strategy, where a number of candidate classifiers are trained, and a set of several classifiers that are accurate and diverse are selected to solve a problem. In this paper, the hybrid approach called D3C is presented; this approach is a hybrid model of ensemble pruning that is based on k-means clustering and the framework of dynamic selection and circulating in combination with a sequential search method. Additionally, a multi-label D3C is derived from D3C through employing a problem transformation for multi-label classification. Empirical study shows that D3C exhibits competitive performance against other high-performance methods, and experiments in multi-label datasets verify the feasibility of multi-label D3C.

AB Channel estimation is very challenging when the receiver is equipped with a limited number of radio-frequency 9RF) chains in beamspace millimeter-wave massive multipleinput and multiple-output systems. To solve this problem, we exploit a learned denoising-based approximate message passing 9LDAMP) network. This neural network can learn channel structure and estimate channel from a large number of training data. Furthermore, we provide an analytical framework on the asymptotic performance of the channel estimator. Based on our analysis and simulation results, the LDAMP neural network significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compressed sensing-based algorithms even when the receiver is equipped with a small number of RF chains.

AB The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for patient care and will be increasingly important as disease modifying agents become available, early in the course of the disease. Although studies have applied machine learning methods for the computer-aided diagnosis of AD, a bottleneck in the diagnostic performance was shown in previous methods, due to the lacking of efficient strategies for representing neuroimaging biomarkers. In this study, we designed a novel diagnostic framework with deep learning architecture to aid the diagnosis of AD. This framework uses a zero-masking strategy for data fusion to extract complementary information from multiple data modalities. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art workflows, our method is capable of fusing multimodal neuroimaging features in one setting and has the potential to require less labeled data. A performance gain was achieved in both binary classification and multiclass classification of AD. The advantages and limitations of the proposed framework are discussed.

AB Short-term building cooling load prediction is the essential foundation for many building energy management tasks, such as fault detection and diagnosis, demand-side management and control optimization. Conventional methods, which heavily rely on physical principles, have limited power in practice as their performance is subject to many physical assumptions. By contrast, data-driven methods have gained huge interests due to their flexibility in model development and the rich data available in modern buildings. The rapid development in data science has provided advanced data analytics to tackle prediction problems in a more convenient, efficient and effective way.
   This paper investigates the potential of one of the most promising techniques in advanced data analytics, i.e., deep learning, in predicting 24-h ahead building cooling load profiles. Deep learning refers to a collection of machine learning algorithms which are powerful in revealing nonlinear and complex patterns in big data. Deep learning can be used either in a supervised manner to develop prediction models with given inputs and output (i.e., cooling load), or in an unsupervised manner to extract meaningful features from raw data as model inputs. This study exploits the potential of deep learning in both manners, and compares its performance in cooling load prediction with typical feature extraction methods and popular prediction techniques in the building field. The results show that deep learning can enhance the performance of building cooling load prediction, especially when used in an unsupervised manner for constructing high-level features as model inputs. Using the features extracted by unsupervised deep learning as inputs for cooling load prediction can evidently enhance the prediction performance. The findings are enlightening and could bring more flexible and effective solutions for building energy predictions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate and timely spatial classification of crop types based on remote sensing data is important for both scientific and practical purposes. Spatially explicit crop-type information can be used to estimate crop areas for a variety of monitoring and decision-making applications such as crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and financial market forecasting. However, there is no publically available spatially explicit in-season crop-type classification information for the U.S. Corn Belt (a landscape predominated by corn and soybean). Instead, researchers and decision-makers have to wait until four to six months after harvest to have such information from the previous year. The state-of-the-art research on crop-type classification has been shifted from relying on only spectral features of single static images to combining together spectral and time-series information. While Landsat data have a desirable spatial resolution for field-level crop-type classification, the ability to extract temporal phenology information based on Landsat data remains a challenge due to low temporal revisiting frequency and inevitable cloud contamination. To address this challenge and generate accurate, cost-effective, and in-season crop-type classification, this research uses the USDA's Common Land Units (CLUs) to aggregate spectral information for each field based on a time-series Landsat image data stack to largely overcome the cloud contamination issue while exploiting a machine learning model based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and high-performance computing for intelligent and scalable computation of classification processes. Experiments were designed to evaluate what information is most useful for training the machine learning model for crop-type classification, and how various spatial and temporal factors affect the crop-type classification performance in order to derive timely crop type information. All experiments were conducted over Champaign County located in central Illinois, and a total of 1322 Landsat multi-temporal scenes including all the six optical spectral bands spanning from 2000 to 2015 were used. Computational experiments show the inclusion of temporal phenology information and evenly distributed spatial training samples in the study domain improves classification performance. The shortwave infrared bands show notably better performance than the widely used visible and near-infrared bands for classifying corn and soybean. In comparison with USDA's Crop Data Layer (CDL), this study found a relatively high Overall Accuracy (i.e. the number of the corrected classified fields divided by the number of the total fields) of 96% for classifying corn and soybean across all CLU fields in the Champaign County from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, our approach achieved 95% Overall Accuracy by late July of the concurrent year for classifying corn and soybean. The findings suggest the methodology presented in this paper is promising for accurate, cost-effective, and in-season classification of field-level crop types, which may be scaled up to large geographic extents such as the U.S. Corn Belt.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a general term that implies the use of a computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention. Al is generally accepted as having started with the invention of robots. The term derives from the Czech word robota, meaning biosynthetic machines used as forced labor. In this field, Leonardo Da Vinci's lasting heritage is today's burgeoning use of robotic-assisted surgery, named after him, for complex urologic and gynecologic procedures. Da Vinci's sketchbooks of robots helped set the stage for this innovation. AI, described as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, was officially born in 1956. The term is applicable to a broad range of items in medicine such as robotics, medical diagnosis, medical statistics, and human biology up to and including today's "omics". AI in medicine, which is the focus of this review, has two main branches: virtual and physical. The virtual branch includes informatics approaches from deep learning information management to control of health management systems, including electronic health records, and active guidance of physicians in their treatment decisions. The physical branch is best represented by robots used to assist the elderly patient or the attending surgeon. Also embodied in this branch are targeted nanorobots, a unique new drug delivery system. The societal and ethical complexities of these applications require further reflection, proof of their medical utility, economic value, and development of interdisciplinary strategies for their wider application.

AB Predicting the performance of a tunneling boring machine is vitally important to avoid any possible accidents during tunneling boring. The prediction is not straightforward due to the uncertain geological conditions and the complex rock-machine interactions. Based on the big data obtained from the 72.1 km long tunnel in the Yin-Song Diversion Project in China, this study developed a machine learning model to predict the TBM performance in a real-time manner. The total thrust and the cutterhead torque during a stable period in a boring cycle was predicted in advance by using the machine-returned parameters in the rising period. A long short-term memory model was developed and its accuracy was evaluated. The results show that the variation in the total thrust and cutterhead torque with various geological conditions can be well reflected by the proposed model. This real-time predication shows superior performance than the classical theoretical model in which only a single value can be obtained based on the single measurement of the rock properties. To improve the accuracy of the model a filtering process was proposed. Results indicate that filtering the unnecessary parameters can enhance both the accuracy and the computational efficiency. Finally, the data deficiency was discussed by assuming a parameter was missing. It is found that the missing of a key parameter can significantly reduce the accuracy of the model, while the supplement of a parameter that highly-correlated with the missing one can improve the prediction.

AB This paper presents our method for enabling a UAV quadrotor, equipped with a monocular camera, to autonomously avoid collisions with obstacles in unstructured and unknown indoor environments. When compared to obstacle avoidance in ground vehicular robots, UAV navigation brings in additional challenges because the UAV motion is no more constrained to a well-defined indoor ground or street environment. Unlike ground vehicular robots, a UAV has to navigate across more types of obstacles - for e.g., objects like decorative items, furnishings, ceiling fans, sign-boards, tree branches, etc., are also potential obstacles for a UAV. Thus, methods of obstacle avoidance developed for ground robots are clearly inadequate for UAV navigation. Current control methods using monocular images for UAV obstacle avoidance are heavily dependent on environment information. These controllers do not fully retain and utilize the extensively available information about the ambient environment for decision making. We propose a deep reinforcement learning based method for UAV obstacle avoidance (OA) which is capable of doing exactly the same. The crucial idea in our method is the concept of partial observability and how UAVs can retain relevant information about the environment structure to make better future navigation decisions. Our OA technique uses recurrent neural networks with temporal attention and provides better results compared to prior works in terms of distance covered without collisions. In addition, our technique has a high inference rate and reduces power wastage as it minimizes oscillatory motion of UAV.

AB Hashing is an efficient method for nearest neighbor search in large-scale data space by embedding high-dimensional feature descriptors into a similarity preserving Hamming space with a low dimension. However, large-scale high-speed retrieval through binary code has a certain degree of reduction in retrieval accuracy compared to traditional retrieval methods. We have noticed that multi-view methods can well preserve the diverse characteristics of data. Therefore, we try to introduce the multi-view deep neural network into the hash learning field, and design an efficient and innovative retrieval model, which has achieved a significant improvement in retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a supervised multi-view hash model which can enhance the multi-view information through neural networks. This is a completely new hash learning method that combines multi-view and deep learning methods. The proposed method utilizes an effective view stability evaluation method to actively explore the relationship among views, which will affect the optimization direction of the entire network. We have also designed a variety of multi-data fusion methods in the Hamming space to preserve the advantages of both convolution and multi-view. In order to avoid excessive computing resources on the enhancement procedure during retrieval, we set up a separate structure called memory network which participates in training together. The proposed method is systematically evaluated on the CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE and MS-COCO datasets, and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art single-view and multi-view hashing methods.

AB To leverage rich data distributed at the network edge, a new machine-learning paradigm, called edge learning, has emerged where learning algorithms are deployed at the edge for providing intelligent services to mobile users. While computing speeds are advancing rapidly, the communication latency is becoming the bottleneck of fast edge learning. To address this issue, this work is focused on designing a low-latency multi-access scheme for edge learning. To this end, we consider a popular privacy-preserving framework, federated edge learning (FEEL), where a global AI-model at an edge-server is updated by aggregating (averaging) local models trained at edge devices. It is proposed that the updates simultaneously transmitted by devices over broadband channels should be analog aggregated "over-the-air" by exploiting the waveform-superposition property of a multi-access channel. Such broadband analog aggregation (BAA) results in dramatical communication-latency reduction compared with the conventional orthogonal access (i.e., OFDMA). In this work, the effects of BAA on learning performance are quantified targeting a single-cell random network. First, we derive two tradeoffs between communication-and-learning metrics, which are useful for network planning and optimization. The power control ("truncated channel inversion") required for BAA results in a tradeoff between the update-reliability [as measured by the receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)] and the expected update-truncation ratio. Consider the scheduling of cell-interior devices to constrain path loss. This gives rise to the other tradeoff between the receive SNR and fraction of data exploited in learning. Next, the latency-reduction ratio of the proposed BAA with respect to the traditional OFDMA scheme is proved to scale almost linearly with the device population. Experiments based on a neural network and a real dataset are conducted for corroborating the theoretical results.

AB Sarcasm identification on text documents is one of the most challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP), has become an essential research direction, due to its prevalence on social media data. The purpose of our research is to present an effective sarcasm identification framework on social media data by pursuing the paradigms of neural language models and deep neural networks. To represent text documents, we introduce inverse gravity moment based term weighted word embedding model with trigrams. In this way, critical words/terms have higher values by keeping the word-ordering information. In our model, we present a three-layer stacked bidirectional long short-term memory architecture to identify sarcastic text documents. For the evaluation task, the presented framework has been evaluated on three-sarcasm identification corpus. In the empirical analysis, three neural language models (i.e., word2vec, fastText and GloVe), two unsupervised term weighting functions (i.e., term-frequency, and TF-IDF) and eight supervised term weighting functions (i.e., odds ratio, relevance frequency, balanced distributional concentration, inverse question frequency-question frequency-inverse category frequency, short text weighting, inverse gravity moment, regularized entropy and inverse false negative-true positive-inverse category frequency) have been evaluated. For sarcasm identification task, the presented model yields promising results with a classification accuracy of 95.30%.

AB Accurate and timely detection of weeds between and within crop rows in the early growth stage is considered one of the main challenges in site-specific weed management (SSWM). In this context, a robust and innovative automatic object-based image analysis (OBIA) algorithm was developed on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images to design early post-emergence prescription maps. This novel algorithm makes the major contribution. The OBIA algorithm combined Digital Surface Models (DSMs), orthomosaics and machine learning techniques (Random Forest, RF). OBIA-based plant heights were accurately estimated and used as a feature in the automatic sample selection by the RF classifier; this was the second research contribution. RF randomly selected a class balanced training set, obtained the optimum features values and classified the image, requiring no manual training, making this procedure time-efficient and more accurate, since it removes errors due to a subjective manual task. The ability to discriminate weeds was significantly affected by the imagery spatial resolution and weed density, making the use of higher spatial resolution images more suitable. Finally, prescription maps for in-season post-emergence SSWM were created based on the weed mapsthe third research contributionwhich could help farmers in decision-making to optimize crop management by rationalization of the herbicide application. The short time involved in the process (image capture and analysis) would allow timely weed control during critical periods, crucial for preventing yield loss.

TI Machine Learning Topological Invariants with Neural Networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
AB In this Letter we supervisedly train neural networks to distinguish different topological phases in the context of topological band insulators. After training with Hamiltonians of one-dimensional insulators with chiral symmetry, the neural network can predict their topological winding numbers with nearly 100% accuracy, even for Hamiltonians with larger winding numbers that are not included in the training data. These results show a remarkable success that the neural network can capture the global and nonlinear topological features of quantum phases from local inputs. By opening up the neural network, we confirm that the network does learn the discrete version of the winding number formula. We also make a couple of remarks regarding the role of the symmetry and the opposite effect of regularization techniques when applying machine learning to physical systems.

AB As a powerful tool for data regression and classification, neural networks have received considerable attention from researchers in fields such as machine learning, statistics, computer vision and so on. There exists a large body of research work on network training, among which most of them tune the parameters iteratively. Such methods often suffer from local minima and slow convergence. It has been shown that randomization based training methods can significantly boost the performance or efficiency of neural networks. Among these methods, most approaches use randomization either to change the data distributions, and/or to fix a part of the parameters or network configurations. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the earliest work and recent advances as well as some suggestions for future research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Learning from imbalanced datasets is a frequent but challenging task for standard classification algorithms. Although there are different strategies to address this problem, methods that generate artificial data for the minority class constitute a more general approach compared to algorithmic modifications. Standard oversampling methods are variations of the SMOTE algorithm, which generates synthetic samples along the line segment that joins minority class samples. Therefore, these approaches are based on local information, rather on the overall minority class distribution. Contrary to these algorithms, in this paper the conditional version of Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) is used to approximate the true data distribution and generate data for the minority class of various imbalanced datasets. The performance of cGAN is compared against multiple standard oversampling algorithms. We present empirical results that show a significant improvement in the quality of the generated data when cGAN is used as an oversampling algorithm. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Advances in technology have fundamentally changed how information is produced and consumed by all actors involved in tourism. Tourists can now access different sources of information, and they can generate their own content and share their views and experiences. Tourism content shared through social media has become a very influential information source that impacts tourism in terms of both reputation and performance. However, the volume of data on the Internet has reached a level that makes manual processing almost impossible, demanding new analytical approaches. Sentiment analysis is rapidly emerging as an automated process of examining semantic relationships and meaning in reviews. In this article, different sentiment analysis approaches applied in tourism are reviewed and assessed in terms of the datasets used and performances on key evaluation metrics. The article concludes by outlining future research avenues to further advance sentiment analysis in tourism as part of a broader Big Data approach.

AB Adaptive control methods are developed for stability and tracking control of flight systems in the presence of parametric uncertainties. This paper offers a design technique of adaptive sliding mode control (ASMC) for finite-time stabilization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems with parametric uncertainties. Applying the Lyapunov stability concept and finite-time convergence idea, the recommended control method guarantees that the states of the quad-rotor UAV are converged to the origin with a finite-time convergence rate. Furthermore, an adaptive-tuning scheme is advised to guesstimate the unknown parameters of the quad-rotor UAV at any moment. Finally, simulation results are presented to exhibit the helpfulness of the offered technique compared to the previous methods. (C) 2017 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Worldwide, energy consumption and saving represent the main challenges for all sectors, most importantly in industrial and domestic sectors. The internet of things (IoT) is a new technology that establishes the core of Industry 4.0. The IoT enables the sharing of signals between devices and machines via the internet. Besides, the IoT system enables the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to manage and control the signals between different machines based on intelligence decisions. The paper's innovation is to introduce a deep learning and IoT based approach to control the operation of air conditioners in order to reduce energy consumption. To achieve such an ambitious target, we have proposed a deep learning-based people detection system utilizing the YOLOv3 algorithm to count the number of persons in a specific area. Accordingly, the operation of the air conditioners could be optimally managed in a smart building. Furthermore, the number of persons and the status of the air conditioners are published via the internet to the dashboard of the IoT platform. The proposed system enhances decision making about energy consumption. To affirm the efficacy and effectiveness of the proposed approach, intensive test scenarios are simulated in a specific smart building considering the existence of air conditioners. The simulation results emphasize that the proposed deep learning-based recognition algorithm can accurately detect the number of persons in the specified area, thanks to its ability to model highly non-linear relationships in data. The detection status can also be successfully published on the dashboard of the IoT platform. Another vital application of the proposed promising approach is in the remote management of diverse controllable devices.

AB Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered as an essential multiple access technique for enhancing system capacity and spectral efficiency in future communication scenarios. However, the existing NOMA systems have a fundamental limit: high computational complexity and a sharply changing wireless channel make exploiting the characteristics of the channel and deriving the ideal allocation methods very difficult tasks. To break this fundamental limit, in this paper, we propose a novel and effective deep learning (DL)-aided NOMA system, in which several NOMA users with random deployment are served by one base station. Since DL is advantageous in that it allows training the input signals and detecting sharply changing channel conditions, we exploit it to address wireless NOMA channels in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, it is employed in the proposed NOMA system to learn a completely unknown channel environment. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network based on DL is incorporated into a typical NOMA system, enabling the proposed scheme to detect the channel characteristics automatically. In the proposed strategy, the LSTM is first trained by simulated data under different channel conditions via offline learning, and then the corresponding output data can be obtained based on the current input data used during the online learning process. In general, we build, train and test the proposed cooperative framework to realize automatic encoding, decoding and channel detection in an additive white Gaussian noise channel. Furthermore, we regard one conventional user activity and data detection scheme as an unknown nonlinear mapping operation and use LSTM to approximate it to evaluate the data detection capacity of DL based on NOMA. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust and efficient compared with conventional approaches. In addition, the accuracy of the LSTM-aided NOMA scheme is studied by introducing the well-known tenfold cross-validation procedure.

DE Face Alignment; face landmark detection; deep learning; convolutional

AB In this study, we show that landmark detection or face alignment task is not a single and independent problem. Instead, its robustness can be greatly improved with auxiliary information. Specifically, we jointly optimize landmark detection together with the recognition of heterogeneous but subtly correlated facial attributes, such as gender, expression, and appearance attributes. This is non-trivial since different attribute inference tasks have different learning difficulties and convergence rates. To address this problem, we formulate a novel tasks-constrained deep model, which not only learns the inter-task correlation but also employs dynamic task coefficients to facilitate the optimization convergence when learning multiple complex tasks. Extensive evaluations show that the proposed task-constrained learning (i) outperforms existing face alignment methods, especially in dealing with faces with severe occlusion and pose variation, and (ii) reduces model complexity drastically compared to the state-of-the-art methods based on cascaded deep model.

AB In this survey paper, we characterize the learning problem in cognitive radios (CRs) and state the importance of artificial intelligence in achieving real cognitive communications systems. We review various learning problems that have been studied in the context of CRs classifying them under two main categories: Decision-making and feature classification. Decision-making is responsible for determining policies and decision rules for CRs while feature classification permits identifying and classifying different observation models. The learning algorithms encountered are categorized as either supervised or unsupervised algorithms. We describe in detail several challenging learning issues that arise in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), in particular in non-Markovian environments and decentralized networks, and present possible solution methods to address them. We discuss similarities and differences among the presented algorithms and identify the conditions under which each of the techniques may be applied.

AB Stock exchange forecasting is an important aspect of business investment plans. The customers prefer to invest in stocks rather than traditional investments due to high profitability. The high profit is often linked with high risk due to the nonlinear nature of data and complex economic rules. The stock markets are often volatile and change abruptly due to the economic conditions, political situation and major events for the country. Therefore, to investigate the effect of some major events more specifically global and local events for different top stock companies (country-wise) remains an open research area. In this study, we consider four countries- US, Hong Kong, Turkey, and Pakistan from developed, emerging and underdeveloped economies' list. We have explored the effect of different major events occurred during 2012-2016 on stock markets. We use the Twitter dataset to calculate the sentiment analysis for each of these events. The dataset consists of 11.42 million tweets that were used to determine the event sentiment. We have used linear regression, support vector regression and deep learning for stock exchange forecasting. The performance of the system is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results show that performance improves by using the sentiment for these events.

AB Objective: To evaluate the design characteristics of studies that evaluated the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for the diagnostic analysis of medical images.
   Materials and Methods: PubMed MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched to identify original research articles published between January 1, 2018 and August 17, 2018 that investigated the performance of AI algorithms that analyze medical images to provide diagnostic decisions. Eligible articles were evaluated to determine 1) whether the study used external validation rather than internal validation, and in case of external validation, whether the data for validation were collected, 2) with diagnostic cohort design instead of diagnostic case-control design, 3) from multiple institutions, and 4) in a prospective manner. These are fundamental methodologic features recommended for clinical validation of AI performance in real-world practice. The studies that fulfilled the above criteria were identified. We classified the publishing journals into medical vs. non-medical journal groups. Then, the results were compared between medical and non-medical journals
   Results: Of 516 eligible published studies, only 6% (31 studies) performed external validation. None of the 31 studies adopted all three design features: diagnostic cohort design, the inclusion of multiple institutions, and prospective data collection for external validation. No significant difference was found between medical and non-medical journals.
   Conclusion: Nearly all of the studies published in the study period that evaluated the performance of AI algorithms for diagnostic analysis of medical images were designed as proof-of-concept technical feasibility studies and did not have the design features that are recommended for robust validation of the real-world clinical performance of AI algorithms.

Specifically, the study examines each of these four technologies in depth, to understand their key elements, the domains in which they operate, and current use cases pertaining to these technologies. The adoption of these new-age technologies is expected to have an impact on the outcomes for firms and customers. However, these are dynamically evolving technologies that have not yet been completely explored and whose full potential has yet to be uncovered. This study presents some research questions that are pertinent to key entities (firms, customers, intermediaries, developers, and regulators), and which merit deeper investigation in the future. This study also highlights major areas that need managerial focus in the adoption of these new-age technologies.

AB With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, we have assisted to the development of new epidemic models or the application of existing methodologies to predict the virus spread and to analyze how the different lock-down strategies can effectively influence the epidemic diffusion. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning based framework able to estimate the parameters of any epidemiological model, such as contact rates and recovery rates, based on static and dynamic features of places. In particular, we model mobility data through a graph series whose spatial and temporal features are investigated by combining Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) and Long short-term memories (LSTMs) in order to infer the parameters of SIR and SIRD models. We evaluate the proposed approach using data related to the COVID-19 dynamics in Italy and we compare the forecasts of the trained model with available data about the epidemic spread.

AB Soft-sensing techniques are of great significance in industrial processes for monitoring and prediction of key performance indicators. Due to the effectiveness of nonlinear feature extraction and strong expansibility, an autoencoder (AE) and its extensions have been widely developed for industrial applications. Nevertheless, an AE commonly uses the last hidden layer for regression modeling with the output, which seems to be a kind of information waste as the shallow layers are also abstractions of input data. Besides, when there are excessive unlabeled samples, AE-based models are less likely to make full use of them or even degrade the performance. To deal with these issues, a method called ensemble semi-supervised gated stacked AE (ES(2)GSAE) is proposed in this article. Gate units are used to develop connections between different layers and the output layer, which also help quantify the contribution of different hidden layers. Moreover, the idea of ensemble learning is combined with semi-supervised learning, in which different unlabeled datasets are used for training different submodels to ensure their diversities. In this way, unlabeled samples can be utilized more efficiently and help enhance the model performance. The effectiveness and superiority are verified in a real industrial process by comparing the proposed method with other typical AE-based models.

AB The game of chess is the longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go.

AB In this paper, we present an extended state observer-based robust dynamic surface trajectory tracking controller for a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle subject to parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. First, the original cascaded dynamics of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle is formulated in a strict form with lumped disturbances to facilitate the backstepping design. Second, based on the separate outer- and inner-loop control methodologies, the extended state observers are constructed to online estimate the unmeasurable velocity states and lumped disturbances existed in translational and rotational dynamics, respectively. Third, to overcome the problem of explosion of complexity inherent in backstepping control, the technique of dynamic surface control is utilized for trajectory tracking and attitude stabilization, and with the velocity and disturbance estimates incorporated into the dynamic surface control, a robust dynamic surface flight controller that guarantees asymptotic tracking in the presence of lumped disturbances is synthesized. In addition, the stability analysis is given, showing that the present robust controller can ensure the ultimate boundedness of all signals in the closed-loop system and make the tracking errors arbitrarily small. Finally, comparisons and extensive simulations under different flight scenarios are performed to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme in accurate tracking performance and enhanced antidisturbance capability.

AB Cognitive computing is an interdisciplinary research field that simulates human thought processes in a computerized model. One application for cognitive computing is sentiment analysis on online reviews, which reflects opinions and attitudes toward products and services experienced by consumers. A high level of classification performance facilitates decision making for both consumers and firms. However, while much effort has been made to propose advanced classification algorithms to improve the performance, the importance of the textual quality of the data has been ignored. This research explores the impact of two influential textual features, namely the word count and review readability, on the performance of sentiment classification. We apply three representative deep learning techniques, namely SRN, LSTM, and CNN, to sentiment analysis tasks on a benchmark movie reviews dataset. Multiple regression models are further employed for statistical analysis. Our findings show that the dataset with reviews having a short length and high readability could achieve the best performance compared with any other combinations of the levels of word count and readability and that controlling the review length is more effective for garnering a higher level of accuracy than increasing the readability. Based on these findings, a practical application, i.e., a text evaluator or a website plug-in for text evaluation, can be developed to provide a service of review editorials and quality control for crowd-sourced review websites. These findings greatly contribute to generating more valuable reviews with high textual quality to better serve sentiment analysis and decision making.

TI Transfer Independently Together: A Generalized Framework for Domain

DE Domain adaptation; landmark selection; subspace learning; transfer
   learning
AB Currently, unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation in a generalized setting, which is the most common scenario in real-world applications, is under insufficient exploration. Existing approaches either are limited to special cases or require labeled target samples for training. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a generalized framework, named as transfer independently together (TIT). Specifically, we learn multiple transformations, one for each domain (independently), to map data onto a shared latent space, where the domains are well aligned. The multiple transformations are jointly optimized in a unified framework (together) by an effective formulation. In addition, to learn robust transformations, we further propose a novel landmark selection algorithm to reweight samples, i.e., increase the weight of pivot samples and decrease the weight of outliers. Our landmark selection is based on graph optimization. It focuses on sample geometric relationship rather than sample features. As a result, by abstracting feature vectors to graph vertices, only a simple and fast integer arithmetic is involved in our algorithm instead of matrix operations with float point arithmetic in existing approaches. At last, we effectively optimize our objective via a dimensionality reduction procedure. 'TIT is applicable to arbitrary sample dimensionality and does not need labeled target samples for training. Extensive evaluations on several standard benchmarks and large-scale datasets of image classification, text categorization and text-to-image recognition verify the superiority of our approach.

TI Richer Convolutional Features for Edge Detection
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Edge detection; deep learning; richer convolutional features
AB Edge detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have pushed forward this field significantly. Existing methods which adopt specific layers of deep CNNs may fail to capture complex data structures caused by variations of scales and aspect ratios. In this paper, we propose an accurate edge detector using richer convolutional features (RCF). RCF encapsulates all convolutional features into more discriminative representation, which makes good usage of rich feature hierarchies, and is amenable to training via backpropagation. RCF fully exploits multiscale and multilevel information of objects to perform the image-to-image prediction holistically. Using VGG16 network, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on several available datasets. When evaluating on the well-known BSDS500 benchmark, we achieve ODS F-measure of 0.811 while retaining a fast speed (8 FPS). Besides, our fast version of RCF achieves ODS F-measure of 0.806 with 30 FPS. We also demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method by applying RCF edges for classical image segmentation.

AB Machine learning approaches for clinical psychology and psychiatry explicitly focus on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals. The goal of this review is to provide an accessible understanding of why this approach is important for future practice given its potential to augment decisions associated with the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of people suffering from mental illness using clinical and biological data. To this end, the limitations of current statistical paradigms in mental health research are critiqued, and an introduction is provided to critical machine learning methods used in clinical studies. A selective literature review is then presented aiming to reinforce the usefulness of machine learning methods and provide evidence of their potential. In the context of promising initial results, the current limitations of machine learning approaches are addressed, and considerations for future clinical translation are outlined.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and people's interactions with it-through virtual agents, socialbots, and language-generation software-do not fit neatly into paradigms of communication theory that have long focused on human-human communication. To address this disconnect between communication theory and emerging technology, this article provides a starting point for articulating the differences between communicative AI and previous technologies and introduces a theoretical basis for navigating these conditions in the form of scholarship within human-machine communication (HMC). Drawing on an HMC framework, we outline a research agenda built around three key aspects of communicative AI technologies: (1) the functional dimensions through which people make sense of these devices and applications as communicators, (2) the relational dynamics through which people associate with these technologies and, in turn, relate to themselves and others, and (3) the metaphysical implications called up by blurring ontological boundaries surrounding what constitutes human, machine, and communication.

AB The rapid development of remote sensing technology has facilitated us the acquisition of remote sensing images with higher and higher spatial resolution, but how to automatically understand the image contents is still a big challenge. In this paper, we develop a practical and rotation-invariant framework for multi-class geospatial object detection and geographic image classification based on collection of part detectors (COPD). The COPD is composed of a set of representative and discriminative part detectors, where each part detector is a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier used for the detection of objects or recurring spatial patterns within a certain range of orientation. Specifically, when performing multi-class geospatial object detection, we learn a set of seed-based part detectors where each part detector corresponds to a particular viewpoint of an object class, so the collection of them provides a solution for rotation-invariant detection of multi-class objects. When performing geographic image classification, we utilize a large number of pre-trained part detectors to discovery distinctive visual parts from images and use them as attributes to represent the images. Comprehensive evaluations on two remote sensing image databases and comparisons with some state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the developed framework.

AB Financial systemic risk is an important issue in economics and financial systems. Trying to detect and respond to systemic risk with growing amounts of data produced in financial markets and systems, a lot of researchers have increasingly employed machine learning methods. Machine learning methods study the mechanisms of outbreak and contagion of systemic risk in the financial network and improve the current regulation of the financial market and industry. In this paper, we survey existing researches and methodologies on assessment and measurement of financial systemic risk combined with machine learning technologies, including big data analysis, network analysis and sentiment analysis, etc. In addition, we identify future challenges, and suggest further research topics. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce current researches on financial systemic risk with machine learning methods and to propose directions for future work.

AB Over the last years, the amount, variety, and complexity of neuroimaging data acquired in patients with brain tumors for routine clinical purposes and the resulting number of imaging parameters have substantially increased. Consequently, a timely and cost-effective evaluation of imaging data is hardly feasible without the support of methods from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). AI can facilitate and shorten various timeconsuming steps in the image processing workflow, e.g., tumor segmentation, thereby optimizing productivity. Besides, the automated and computer-based analysis of imaging data may help to increase data comparability as it is independent of the experience level of the evaluating clinician. Importantly, AI offers the potential to extract new features from the routinely acquired neuroimages of brain tumor patients. In combination with patient data such as survival, molecular markers, or genomics, mathematical models can be generated that allow, for example, the prediction of treatment response or prognosis, as well as the noninvasive assessment of molecular markers. The subdiscipline of AI dealing with the computation, identification, and extraction of image features, as well as the generation of prognostic or predictive mathematical models, is termed radiomics. This review article summarizes the basics, the current workflow, and methods used in radiomics with a focus on feature-based radiomics in neuro-oncology and provides selected examples of its clinical application.

AB Appearance is a very important sensory quality attribute of fruits and vegetables, which can influence not only their market value, consumer's preferences and choice but also their internal quality to some extent. External quality of fruits and vegetables is generally evaluated by considering their color, texture, size, shape, as well as the visual defects. External quality inspection of fruits and vegetables manually is a time-consuming and labor intensive work Over the past decades, computer vision systems, including traditional computer vision system, hyperspectral computer vision system, and multispectral computer vision system, have been widely used in the food industry, and proved to be scientific and powerful tools for the automatic external quality inspection of food and agricultural products. Many researches based on spatial image and/or spectral image processing and analysis have been published proposing the use of computer vision technique in the field of external quality inspection of fruits and vegetables. This paper presents a detailed overview of the comparative introduction, latest developments and applications of computer vision systems in the external quality inspection of fruits and vegetables. Additionally, the principal components, basic theories, and corresponding processing and analytical methods are also reported in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Facial expressions are an important way through which humans interact socially. Building a system capable of automatically recognizing facial expressions from images and video has been an intense field of study in recent years. Interpreting such expressions remains challenging and much research is needed about the way they relate to human affect. This paper presents a general overview of automatic RGB, 3D, thermal and multimodal facial expression analysis. We define a new taxonomy for the field, encompassing all steps from face detection to facial expression recognition, and describe and classify the state of the art methods accordingly. We also present the important datasets and the bench-marking of most influential methods. We conclude with a general discussion about trends, important questions and future lines of research.

SO IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Medical image segmentation; fuzzy clustering; transfer learning;
   negative transfer
AB Traditional clustering algorithms for medical image segmentation can only achieve satisfactory clustering performance under relatively ideal conditions, in which there is adequate data from the same distribution, and the data is rarely disturbed by noise or outliers. However, a sufficient amount of medical images with representative manual labels are often not available, because medical images are frequently acquired with different scanners (or different scan protocols) or polluted by various noises. Transfer learning improves learning in the target domain by leveraging knowledge from related domains. Given some target data, the performance of transfer learning is determined by the degree of relevance between the source and target domains. To achieve positive transfer and avoid negative transfer, a negative-transfer-resistant mechanism is proposed by computing the weight of transferred knowledge. Extracting a negative-transfer-resistant fuzzy clustering model with a shared cross-domain transfer latent space (called NTR-FC-SCT) is proposed by integrating negative-transfer-resistant and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) into the framework of fuzzy c-means clustering. Experimental results show that the proposed NTR-FC-SCT model outperformed several traditional non-transfer and related transfer clustering algorithms.

AB Artificial Intelligent (AI) In-home Voice Assistants have seen unprecedented growth. However, we have little understanding on the factors motivating individuals to use such devices. Given the unique characteristics of the technology, in the main hands free, controlled by voice, and the presentation of a voice user interface, the current technology adoption models are not comprehensive enough to explain the adoption of this new technology. Focusing on voice interactions, this research combines the theoretical foundations of U&GT with technology theories to gain a clearer understanding on the motivations for adopting and using in-home voice assistants. This research presents a conceptual model on the use of voice controlled technology and an empirical validation of the model through the use of Structural Equation Modelling with a sample of 724 in-home voice assistant users. The findings illustrate that individuals are motivated by the (1) utilitarian benefits, (2) symbolic benefits and (3) social benefits provided by voice assistants, the results found that hedonic benefits only motivate the use of in-home voice assistants in smaller households. Additionally, the research establishes a moderating role of perceived privacy risks in dampening and negatively influencing the use of in-home voice assistants.

AB As the 5G standard is being completed, academia and industry have begun to consider a more developed cellular communication technique, 6G, which is expected to achieve high data rates up to 1 Tb/s and broad frequency bands of 100 GHz to 3 THz. Besides the significant upgrade of the key communication metrics, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been envisioned by many researchers as the most important feature of 6G, since the state-of-the-art machine learning technique has been adopted as the top solution in many extremely complex scenarios. Network intelligentization will be the new trend to address the challenges of exponentially increasing number of connected heterogeneous devices. However, compared with the application of machine learning in other fields, such as computer games, current research on intelligent networking still has a long way to go to realize the automatically- configured cellular communication systems. Various problems in terms of communication system, machine learning architectures, and computation efficiency should be addressed for the full use of this technique in 6G. In this paper, we analyze machine learning techniques and introduce 10 most critical challenges in advancing the intelligent 6G system.

AB The most important factor in planning and operating water distribution systems is satisfying consumer demand. This means continuously providing users with quality water in adequate volumes at reasonable pressure, thus ensuring reliable water distribution. In recent years, the application of statistical, machine learning, and artificial intelligence methodologies has been fostered for water demand forecasting. However, there is still room for improvement; and new challenges regarding on-line predictive models for water demand have appeared. This work proposes applying support vector regression, as one of the currently better machine learning options for short-term water demand forecasting, to build a base prediction. On this model, a Fourier time series process is built to improve the base prediction. This addition produces a tool able to eliminate many of the errors and much of the bias inherent in a fixed regression structure when responding to new incoming time series data. The final hybrid process is validated using demand data from a water utility in Franca, Brazil. Our model, being a near real-time model for water demand, may be directly exploited in water management decision-making processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain have become two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. Blockchain technology has the ability to automate payment in cryptocurrency and to provide access to a shared ledger of data, transactions, and logs in a decentralized, secure, and trusted manner. Also with smart contracts, blockchain has the ability to govern interactions among participants with no intermediary or a trusted third party. AI, on the other hand, offers intelligence and decision-making capabilities for machines similar to humans. In this paper, we present a detailed survey on blockchain applications for AI. We review the literature, tabulate, and summarize the emerging blockchain applications, platforms, and protocols specifically targeting AI area. We also identify and discuss open research challenges of utilizing blockchain technologies for AI.

AB High spatial resolution three-dimensional (3D) measurements of vegetation by remote sensing are advancing ecological research and environmental management However, substantial economic and logistical costs limit this application, especially for observing phenological dynamics in ecosystem structure and spectral traits. Here we demonstrate a new aerial remote sensing system enabling routine and inexpensive aerial 3D measurements of canopy structure and spectral attributes, with properties similar to those of LIDAR, but with RGB (red-green-blue) spectral attributes for each point, enabling high frequency observations within a single growing season. This "Ecosynth" methodology applies photogrammetric "Structure from Motion" computer vision algorithms to large sets of highly overlapping low altitude (<130 m) aerial photographs acquired using off-the-shelf digital cameras mounted on an inexpensive (<USD$4000), lightweight (<2 kg), hobbyist-grade unmanned aerial system (UAS). Ecosynth 3D point clouds with densities of 30-67 points M-2 were produced using commercial computer vision software from digital photographs acquired repeatedly by UAS over three 625 ha (250 m x 250 m) Temperate Deciduous forest sites in Maryland USA. Ecosynth point clouds were georeferenced with a precision of 1.2-4.1 m horizontal radial root mean square error (RMSE) and 0.4-12 m vertical RMSE. Understory digital terrain models (DTMs) and canopy height models (CHMs) were generated from leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds using procedures commonly applied to LIDAR point clouds. At two sites, Ecosynth CHMs were strong predictors of field-measured tree heights (R-2 0.63 to 0.84) and were highly correlated with a LIDAR CHM (R 0.87) acquired 4 days earlier, though Ecosynth-based estimates of aboveground biomass and carbon densities included significant errors (31-36% of field-based estimates). Repeated scanning of a 50 m x 50 m forested area at six different times across a 16 month period revealed ecologically significant dynamics in canopy color at different heights and a structural shift upward in canopy density, as demonstrated by changes in vertical height profiles of point density and relative RGB brightness. Changes in canopy relative greenness were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.87) with MODIS NDVI time series for the same area and vertical differences in canopy color revealed the early green up of the dominant canopy species, Liriodendron tulipifera, strong evidence that Ecosynth time series measurements can capture vegetation structural and spectral phenological dynamics at the spatial scale of individual trees. The ability to observe canopy phenology in 3D at high temporal resolutions represents a breakthrough in forest ecology. Inexpensive user-deployed technologies for multispectral 3D scanning of vegetation at landscape scales (<1 km(2)) heralds a new era of participatory remote sensing by field ecologists, community foresters and the interested public.

AB Signal peptides (SPs) are short amino acid sequences in the amino terminus of many newly synthesized proteins that target proteins into, or across, membranes. Bioinformatic tools can predict SPs from amino acid sequences, but most cannot distinguish between various types of signal peptides. We present a deep neural network-based approach that improves SP prediction across all domains of life and distinguishes between three types of prokaryotic SPs.

AB Objectives: Sepsis is among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and cost overruns in critically ill patients. Early intervention with antibiotics improves survival in septic patients. However, no clinically validated system exists for real-time prediction of sepsis onset. We aimed to develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction of sepsis.
   Design: Observational cohort study.
   Setting: Academic medical center from January 2013 to December 2015.
   Patients: Over 31,000 admissions to the ICUs at two Emory University hospitals (development cohort), in addition to over 52,000 ICU patients from the publicly available Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III ICU database (validation cohort). Patients who met the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis (Sepsis-3) prior to or within 4 hours of their ICU admission were excluded, resulting in roughly 27,000 and 42,000 patients within our development and validation cohorts, respectively.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: High-resolution vital signs time series and electronic medical record data were extracted. A set of 65 features (variables) were calculated on hourly basis and passed to the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert algorithm to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours (where T = 12, 8, 6, or 4). Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert was used to predict onset of sepsis in the proceeding T hours and to produce a list of the most significant contributing factors. For the 12-, 8-, 6-, and 4-hour ahead prediction of sepsis, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic in the range of 0.83-0.85. Performance of the Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert on the development and validation cohorts was indistinguishable.
   Conclusions: Using data available in the ICU in real-time, Artificial Intelligence Sepsis Expert can accurately predict the onset of sepsis in an ICU patient 4-12 hours prior to clinical recognition. A prospective study is necessary to determine the clinical utility of the proposed sepsis prediction model.

AB Neural networks have been extensively applied to short-term traffic prediction in the past years. This study proposes a novel architecture of neural networks, Long Short-Term Neural Network (LSTM NN), to capture nonlinear traffic dynamic in an effective manner. The LSTM NN can overcome the issue of back-propagated error decay through memory blocks, and thus exhibits the superior capability for time series prediction with long temporal dependency. In addition, the LSTM NN can automatically determine the optimal time lags. To validate the effectiveness of LSTM NN, travel speed data from traffic microwave detectors in Beijing are used for model training and testing. A comparison with different topologies of dynamic neural networks as well as other prevailing parametric and nonparametric algorithms suggests that LSTM NN can achieve the best prediction performance in terms of both accuracy and stability.

AB Long short-term memory (LSTM) is widely used to process and predict events with time series, but it is difficult to solve exceedingly long-term dependencies, possibly because the LSTM errors increase as the sequence length increases. Recently, researchers have noted that adding features on multiple time scales can help improve the long-term dependency of the RNN, which is inspired by the attention mechanism, considering the need for historical data in traffic flow prediction. We propose an improved approach that connects the high-impact value of remarkably long sequence time steps to the current time step, and these high-impact traffic flow values are captured using the attention mechanism. At the same time, we smooth out some data beyond the normal range to obtain better prediction results. The experimental results show that the proposed prediction model has certain competitiveness in short-term traffic flow predictions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the invention of the low-cost Microsoft Kinect sensor, high-resolution depth and visual (RGB) sensing has become available for widespread use. The complementary nature of the depth and visual information provided by the Kinect sensor opens up new opportunities to solve fundamental problems in computer vision. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent Kinect-based computer vision algorithms and applications. The reviewed approaches are classified according to the type of vision problems that can be addressed or enhanced by means of the Kinect sensor. The covered topics include preprocessing, object tracking and recognition, human activity analysis, hand gesture analysis, and indoor 3-D mapping. For each category of methods, we outline their main algorithmic contributions and summarize their advantages/differences compared to their RGB counterparts. Finally, we give an overview of the challenges in this field and future research trends. This paper is expected to serve as a tutorial and source of references for Kinect-based computer vision researchers.

AB In the past decade, there has been a tremendous increase in the use of neurophysiological methods to better understand marketing phenomena among academics and practitioners. However, the value of these methods in predicting advertising success remains underresearched. Using a unique experimental protocol to assess responses to 30-second television ads, the authors capture many measures of advertising effectiveness across six commonly used methods (traditional self-reports, implicit measures, eye tracking, biometrics, electroencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging). These measures have been shown to reliably tap into higher-level constructs commonly used in advertising research: attention, affect, memory, and desirability. Using time-series data on sales and gross rating points, the authors attempt to relate individual-level response to television ads in the lab to the ads' aggregate, market-level elasticities. The authors show that functional magnetic resonance imaging measures explain the most variance in advertising elasticities beyond the baseline traditional measures. Notably, activity in the ventral striatum is the strongest predictor of real-world, market-level response to advertising. The authors discuss the findings and their significant implications for theory, research, and practice.

AB Fungal infection represents up to 50% of yield losses, making it necessary to apply effective and cost efficient fungicide treatments, whose efficacy depends on infestation type, situation and time. In these cases, a correct and early identification of the specific infection is mandatory to minimize yield losses and increase the efficacy and efficiency of the treatments. Over the last years, a number of image analysis-based methodologies have been proposed for automatic image disease identification. Among these methods, the use of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has proven tremendously successful for different visual classification tasks.
   In this work we extend previous work by Johannes et al. (2017) with an adapted Deep Residual Neural Network-based algorithm to deal with the detection of multiple plant diseases in real acquisition conditions where different adaptions for early disease detection have been proposed. This work analyses the performance of early identification of three relevant European endemic wheat diseases: Septoria (Septoria triad), Tan Spot (Drechslera triciti-repentis) and Rust (Puccinia striiformis & Puccinia recondita). The analysis was done using different mobile devices, and more than 8178 images were captured in two pilot sites in Spain and Germany during 2014, 2015 and 2016. Obtained results reveal an overall improvement of the balanced accuracy from 0.78 (Johannes et al., 2017) up to 0.87 under exhaustive testing, and balanced accuracies greater than 0.96 on a pilot test performed in Germany.

   CINGULATE CORTEX; ANTERIOR INSULA; BRAIN; AGENCY
AB We describe a theoretical model of the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying conscious presence and its disturbances. The model is based on interoceptive prediction error and is informed by predictive models of agency, general models of hierarchical predictive coding and dopaminergic signaling in cortex, the role of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) in interoception and emotion, and cognitive neuroscience evidence from studies of virtual reality and of psychiatric disorders of presence, specifically depersonalization/derealization disorder. The model associates presence with successful suppression by top-down predictions of informative interoceptive signals evoked by autonomic control signals and, indirectly, by visceral responses to afferent sensory signals. The model connects presence to agency by allowing that predicted interoceptive signals will depend on whether afferent sensory signals are determined, by a parallel predictive-coding mechanism, to be self-generated or externally caused. Anatomically, we identify the AIC as the likely locus of key neural comparator mechanisms. Our model integrates a broad range of previously disparate evidence, makes predictions for conjoint manipulations of agency and presence, offers a new view of emotion as interoceptive inference, and represents a step toward a mechanistic account of a fundamental phenomenological property of consciousness.

AB Coefficient of consolidation (Cv) is a measure of compressibility of soil. This coefficient is an important parameter which is used in the design of foundation of civil engineering structures and also in the slope stability analysis. In this study, the main objective is to propose a hybrid machine learning approach named MLP-BBO for the prediction of the coefficient of consolidation of soft soil. This method is based on Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP) and Biogeography-based Optimization (BBO). For this, a total number of 164 soil samples were collected from the Tan Vu-Lach Huyen highway project and Ha Noi-Hai Phong highway project sites. In the modeling, input parameters used include clay (%), moisture content (%), liquid limit (%), plastic limit (%), plasticity index (%), and liquidity index (%). To validate performance of the models, standard methods such as Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and correlation coefficient (r) were used. For the comparison of performance of the models, popular machine learning methods were used namely Backpropagation Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Networks (Bp-MLP Neural Nets), Radial Basis Functions Neural Networks (RBF-Neural Nets), Gaussian Process (GP), M5 Tree, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Results of the model study indicate that the proposed method MLP-BBO has the highest predictive capability (RMSE = 0.397, MAE = 0.302 and r = 0.827), followed by the SVR (RMSE = 0.403, MAE = 0.299 and r = 0.819), the Bp-MLP Neural Nets (RMSE = 0.478, MAE = 0.398 and r = 0.805), the RBF-Neural Nets (RMSE = 0.412, MAE = 0.281 and r = 0.804), the GP (RMSE = 0.440, MAE = 0.301 and r = 0.777), and the M5 Tree (RMSE = 0.494, MAE = 0.322 and r = 0.728), in the prediction of C, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that though performance of all applied models is good in the prediction of the coefficient of consolidation of soil but performance of the MLP-BBO is the best.

AB Rotating machinery fault diagnosis problems have been well-addressed when sufficient supervised data of the tested machine are available using the latest data-driven methods. However, it is still challenging to develop effective diagnostic method with insufficient training data, which is highly demanded in real-industrial scenarios, since high-quality data are usually difficult and expensive to collect. Considering the underlying similarities of rotating machines, data mining on different but related equipments potentially benefit the diagnostic performance on the target machine. Therefore, a novel transfer learning method for diagnostics based on deep learning is proposed in this article, where the diagnostic knowledge learned from sufficient supervised data of multiple rotating machines is transferred to the target equipment with domain adversarial training. Different from the existing studies, a more generalized transfer learning problem with different label spaces of domains is investigated, and different fault severities are also considered in fault diagnostics. The experimental results on four datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show it is feasible and promising to explore different datasets to improve diagnostic performance.

ID KERNEL; FRAMEWORK; SUBSPACE; MATRIX
AB The rapid development of computer hardware and Internet technology makes large scale data dependent models computationally tractable, and opens a bright avenue for annotating images through innovative machine learning algorithms. Semisupervised learning (SSL) therefore received intensive attention in recent years and was successfully deployed in image annotation. One representative work in SSL is Laplacian regularization (LR), which smoothes the conditional distribution for classification along the manifold encoded in the graph Laplacian, however, it is observed that LR biases the classification function toward a constant function that possibly results in poor generalization. In addition, LR is developed to handle uniformly distributed data (or single-view data), although instances or objects, such as images and videos, are usually represented by multiview features, such as color, shape, and texture. In this paper, we present multiview Hessian regularization (mHR) to address the above two problems in LR-based image annotation. In particular, mHR optimally combines multiple HR, each of which is obtained from a particular view of instances, and steers the classification function that varies linearly along the data manifold. We apply mHR to kernel least squares and support vector machines as two examples for image annotation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC'07 dataset validate the effectiveness of mHR by comparing it with baseline algorithms, including LR and HR.

AB Objective: Monitoring athlete internal workload exposure, including prevention of catastrophic non-contact knee injuries, relies on the existence of a custom early-warning detection system. This system must be able to estimate accurate, reliable, and valid musculoskeletal joint loads, for sporting maneuvers in near real-time and during match play. However, current methods are constrained to laboratory instrumentation, are labor and cost intensive, and require highly trained specialist knowledge, thereby limiting their ecological validity and wider deployment. An informative next step towards this goal would be a new method to obtain ground kinetics in the field. Methods: Here we show that kinematic data obtained from wearable sensor accelerometers, in lieu of embedded force platforms, can leverage recent supervised learning techniques to predict near real-time multidimensional ground reaction forces and moments (GRF/M). Competing convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning models were trained using laboratory-derived stance phase GRF/M data and simulated sensor accelerations for running and sidestepping maneuvers derived from nearly half a million legacy motion trials. Then, predictions were made from each model driven by five sensor accelerations recorded during independent inter-laboratory data capture sessions. Results: The proposed deep learning workbench achieved correlations to ground truth, by maximum discrete GRF component, of vertical F-z 0.97, anterior F-y 0.96 (both running), and lateral F-x 0.87 (sidestepping), with the strongest mean recorded across GRF components 0.89, and for GRM 0.65 (both sidestepping). Conclusion: These best-case correlations indicate the plausibility of the approach although the range of results was disappointing. The goal to accurately estimate near real-time on-field GRF/M will be improved by the lessons learned in this study. Significance: Coaching, medical, and allied health staff could ultimately use this technology to monitor a range of joint loading indicators during game play, with the aim to minimize the occurrence of non-contact injuries in elite and community-level sports.

AB High-impact weather events, such as severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes, cause significant disruptions to infrastructure, property loss, and even fatalities. High-impact events can also positively impact society, such as the impact on savings through renewable energy. Prediction of these events has improved substantially with greater observational capabilities, increased computing power, and better model physics, but there is still significant room for improvement. Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science technologies, specifically machine learning and data mining, bridge the gap between numerical model prediction and real-time guidance by improving accuracy. AI techniques also extract otherwise unavailable information from forecast models by fusing model output with observations to provide additional decision support for forecasters and users. In this work, we demonstrate that applying AI techniques along with a physical understanding of the environment can significantly improve the prediction skill for multiple types of high-impact weather. The AI approach is also a contribution to the growing field of computational sustainability. The authors specifically discuss the prediction of storm duration, severe wind, severe hail, precipitation classification, forecasting for renewable energy, and aviation turbulence. They also discuss how AI techniques can process big data, provide insights into high-impact weather phenomena, and improve our understanding of high-impact weather.

AB Recommender systems use algorithms to provide users with product or service recommendations. Recently, these systems have been using machine learning algorithms from the field of artificial intelligence. However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a recommender system is difficult because of the number of algorithms described in the literature. Researchers and practitioners developing recommender systems are left with little information about the current approaches in algorithm usage. Moreover, the development of recommender systems using machine learning algorithms often faces problems and raises questions that must be resolved. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems and identifies new research opportunities. The goals of this study are to (i) identify trends in the use or research of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems; (ii) identify open questions in the use or research of machine learning algorithms; and (iii) assist new researchers to position new research activity in this domain appropriately. The results of this study identify existing classes of recommender systems, characterize adopted machine learning approaches, discuss the use of big data technologies, identify types of machine learning algorithms and their application domains, and analyzes both main and alternative performance metrics.

AB The advent of machines powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics technologies have already strongly influenced the hospitality industry, and the effects of its replacement upon the human workforce has been a highly debated topic. Despite this, empirical evidence in the form of published empirical studies have yet to appear in academic journals that present compelling evidence addressing what hospitality employees' awareness of those potential impacts could be pertaining to AI and robotics specifically applied within the context of their turnover intention and future employment prospects. The purpose of this study was to present new empirical findings on this issue using data from a sample of 468 full-time five star hotel employees in Guangzhou, China. AI and robotics awareness was found to be significantly associated with employee turnover intention. This relationship was moderated by perceived organizational support and competitive psychological climate. Implications and directions for future research are provided.

AB Cloud detection is an important preprocessing step for the precise application of optical satellite imagery. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based cloud detection method named multi-scale convolutional feature fusion (MSCFF) for remote sensing images of different sensors. In the network architecture of MSCFF, the symmetric encoder-decoder module, which provides both local and global context by densifying feature maps with trainable convolutional filter banks, is utilized to extract multi-scale and high-level spatial features. The feature maps of multiple scales are then up-sampled and concatenated, and a novel multi-scale feature fusion module is designed to fuse the features of different scales for the output. The two output feature maps of the network are cloud and cloud shadow maps, which are in turn fed to binary classifiers outside the model to obtain the final cloud and cloud shadow mask. The MSCFF method was validated on hundreds of globally distributed optical satellite images, with spatial resolutions ranging from 0.5 to 50 m, including Landsat-5/7/8, Gaofen-1/2/4, Sentinel-2, Ziyuan-3, CBERS-04, Huanjing-1, and collected high-resolution images exported from Google Earth. The experimental results show that MSCFF achieves a higher accuracy than the traditional rule-based cloud detection methods and the state-of-the-art deep learning models, especially in bright surface covered areas. The effectiveness of MSCFF means that it has great promise for the practical application of cloud detection for multiple types of medium and high-resolution remote sensing images. Our established global high-resolution cloud detection validation dataset has been made available online (http://sendimage.whu.edu.cn/en/mscff/).

AB Background Application of deep-learning technology to skin cancer classification can potentially improve the sensitivity and specificity of skin cancer screening, but the number of training images required for such a system is thought to be extremely large. Objectives To determine whether deep-learning technology could be used to develop an efficient skin cancer classification system with a relatively small dataset of clinical images. Methods A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) was trained using a dataset of 4867 clinical images obtained from 1842 patients diagnosed with skin tumours at the University of Tsukuba Hospital from 2003 to 2016. The images consisted of 14 diagnoses, including both malignant and benign conditions. Its performance was tested against 13 board-certified dermatologists and nine dermatology trainees. Results The overall classification accuracy of the trained DCNN was 76 center dot 5%. The DCNN achieved 96 center dot 3% sensitivity (correctly classified malignant as malignant) and 89 center dot 5% specificity (correctly classified benign as benign). Although the accuracy of malignant or benign classification by the board-certified dermatologists was statistically higher than that of the dermatology trainees (85 center dot 3% +/- 3 center dot 7% and 74 center dot 4% +/- 6 center dot 8%, P < 0 center dot 01), the DCNN achieved even greater accuracy, as high as 92 center dot 4% +/- 2 center dot 1% (P < 0 center dot 001). Conclusions We have developed an efficient skin tumour classifier using a DCNN trained on a relatively small dataset. The DCNN classified images of skin tumours more accurately than board-certified dermatologists. Collectively, the current system may have capabilities for screening purposes in general medical practice, particularly because it requires only a single clinical image for classification.

AB Machine learning is a means to derive artificial intelligence by discovering patterns in existing data. Here, we show that applying machine learning to ordinary human language results in human-like semantic biases. We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. Our methods hold promise for identifying and addressing sources of bias in culture, including technology.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an alternative type of neural network that can be used to reduce spectral variations and model spectral correlations which exist in signals. Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, we hypothesize that CNNs are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying CNNs to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make CNNs effective compared to DNNs for LVCSR tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is an appropriate number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy. Second, investigate how to incorporate speaker-adapted features, which cannot directly be modeled by CNNs as they do not obey locality in frequency, into the CNN framework. Third, given the importance of sequence training for speech tasks, we introduce a strategy to use ReLU+dropout during Hessian-free sequence training of CNNs. Experiments on 3 LVCSR tasks indicate that a CNN with the proposed speaker-adapted and ReLU+dropout ideas allow for a 12%-14% relative improvement in WER over a strong DNN system, achieving state-of-the art results in these 3 tasks.

   Induces Partial Neurological Recovery in Paraplegic Patients

AB Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) provide a new assistive strategy aimed at restoring mobility in severely paralyzed patients. Yet, no study in animals or in human subjects has indicated that long-term BMI training could induce any type of clinical recovery. Eight chronic (3-13 years) spinal cord injury (SCI) paraplegics were subjected to long-term training (12 months) with a multi-stage BMI-based gait neurorehabilitation paradigm aimed at restoring locomotion. This paradigm combined intense immersive virtual reality training, enriched visual-tactile feedback, and walking with two EEG-controlled robotic actuators, including a custom-designed lower limb exoskeleton capable of delivering tactile feedback to subjects. Following 12 months of training with this paradigm, all eight patients experienced neurological improvements in somatic sensation (pain localization, fine/crude touch, and proprioceptive sensing) in multiple dermatomes. Patients also regained voluntary motor control in key muscles below the SCI level, as measured by EMGs, resulting in marked improvement in their walking index. As a result, 50% of these patients were upgraded to an incomplete paraplegia classification. Neurological recovery was paralleled by the reemergence of lower limb motor imagery at cortical level. We hypothesize that this unprecedented neurological recovery results from both cortical and spinal cord plasticity triggered by long-term BMI usage.

AB Deep learning has rapidly advanced in various fields within the past few years and has recently gained particular attention in the radiology community. This article provides an introduction to deep learning technology and presents the stages that are entailed in the design process of deep learning radiology research. In addition, the article details the results of a survey of the application of deep learning-specifically, the application of convolutional neural networks-to radiologic imaging that was focused on the following five major system organs: chest, breast, brain, musculoskeletal system, and abdomen and pelvis. The survey of the studies is followed by a discussion about current challenges and future trends and their potential implications for radiology. This article may be used as a guide for radiologists planning research in the field of radiologic image analysis using convolutional neural networks. (C) RSNA, 2019

AB The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) can obtain traffic information through a large number of data collected by sensors. However, the lack of data, abnormal data, and other low-quality problems have seriously restricted the development and application of the IoV. To solve the problem of missing data in a largescale road network, the previous research achievements show that tensor decomposition method has the advantages in solving multi-dimensional data imputation problems, so we adopt this tensor mode to model traffic velocity data. A new method of data missing estimation with tensor heterogeneous ensemble learning based on FNN (Fuzzy Neural Network) named FNNTEL is proposed in this paper. The performance of this method is evaluated by our experiments and analysis. The proposed method is applied to be tested by the real data captured in Guangzhou and Tianjin of China respectively. A large number of experimental tests show that the performance of the new method is better than other commonly used technologies and different missing data generation models. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Detecting and segmenting salient objects from natural scenes, often referred to as salient object detection, has attracted great interest in computer vision. While many models have been proposed and several applications have emerged, a deep understanding of achievements and issues remains lacking. We aim to provide a comprehensive review of recent progress in salient object detection and situate this field among other closely related areas such as generic scene segmentation, object proposal generation, and saliency for fixation prediction. Covering 228 publications, we survey i) roots, key concepts, and tasks, ii) core techniques and main modeling trends, and iii) datasets and evaluation metrics for salient object detection. We also discuss open problems such as evaluation metrics and dataset bias in model performance, and suggest future research directions.

AB Recent developments in many-body potential energy representation via deep learning have brought new hopes to addressing the accuracy-versus-efficiency dilemma in molecular simulations. Here we describe DeePMD-kit, a package written in Python/C++ that has been designed to minimize the effort required to build deep learning based representation of potential energy and force field and to perform molecular dynamics. Potential applications of DeePMD-kit span from finite molecules to extended systems and from metallic systems to chemically bonded systems. DeePMD-kit is interfaced with TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, making the training process highly automatic and efficient. On the other end, DeePMD-kit is interfaced with high-performance classical molecular dynamics and quantum (path-integral) molecular dynamics packages, i.e., LAMMPS and the i-PI, respectively. Thus, upon training, the potential energy and force field models can be used to perform efficient molecular simulations for different purposes. As an example of the many potential applications of the package, we use DeePMD-kit to learn the interatomic potential energy and forces of a water model using data obtained from density functional theory. We demonstrate that the resulted molecular dynamics model reproduces accurately the structural information contained in the original model.

ID LEARNING DEEP; AUTOENCODERS; RECOGNITION; NETWORKS; MODEL
AB Deep networks have achieved excellent performance in learning representation from visual data. However, the supervised deep models like convolutional neural network require large quantities of labeled data, which are very expensive to obtain. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an unsupervised deep network, called the stacked convolutional denoising auto-encoders, which can map images to hierarchical representations without any label information. The network, optimized by layer-wise training, is constructed by stacking layers of denoising autoencoders in a convolutional way. In each layer, high dimensional feature maps are generated by convolving features of the lower layer with kernels learned by a denoising auto-encoder. The autoencoder is trained on patches extracted from feature maps in the lower layer to learn robust feature detectors. To better train the large network, a layer-wise whitening technique is introduced into the model. Before each convolutional layer, a whitening layer is embedded to sphere the input data. By layers of mapping, raw images are transformed into high-level feature representations which would boost the performance of the subsequent support vector machine classifier. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by extensive experimentations and demonstrates superior classification performance to state-of-the-art unsupervised networks.

AB Glaucoma progressively affects the optic nerve and may cause partial or complete vision loss. Raised intravascular pressure is the only factor which can be modified to prevent blindness from this condition. Accurate early detection and continuous screening may prevent the vision loss. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) is a non-invasive technique which can detect the glaucoma in its early stage using digital fundus images. Developing such a system require diverse huge database in order to reach optimum performance. This paper proposes a novel CAD tool for the accurate detection of glaucoma using deep learning technique. An eighteen layer convolutional neural networks (CNN) is effectively trained in order to extract robust features from the digital fundus images. Finally these features are classified into normal and glaucoma classes during testing. We have achieved the highest accuracy of 98.13% using 1426 (589: normal and 837: glaucoma) fundus images. Our experimental results demonstrates the robustness of the system, which can be used as a supplementary tool for the clinicians to validate their decisions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Artificial intelligence has showed powerful capacity in detecting and diagnosing faults of building energy systems. This paper aims at making a comprehensive literature review of artificial intelligence-based fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) methods for building energy systems in the past twenty years from 1998 to 2018, summarizing the strengths and shortcomings of the existing artificial intelligence-based methods, and revealing the most important research tasks in the future. Challenges in developing FDD methods for building energy systems are discussed firstly. Then, a comprehensive literature review is made. All methods are classified into two categories, i.e. data driven-based and knowledge driven-based. The data driven-based methods are abundant, including the classification-based, unsupervised learning-based and regression-based. They showed powerful capacity in learning patterns from training data. But, they need a large amount of training data, and have problems in reliability and robustness. The knowledge driven-based methods show powerful capacity in simulating the diagnostic thinking of experts. But, they rely on expert knowledge heavily. It is concluded that new artificial intelligence-based methodologies are needed to be able to combine the advantages of both kinds of methods in the future.

AB Due to the poor lighting condition and limited dynamic range of digital imaging devices, the recorded images are often under-/over-exposed and with low contrast. Most of previous single image contrast enhancement (SICE) methods adjust the tone curve to correct the contrast of an input image. Those methods, however, often fail in revealing image details because of the limited information in a single image. On the other hand, the SICE task can be better accomplished if we can learn extra information from appropriately collected training data. In this paper, we propose to use the convolutional neural network (CNN) to train a SICE enhancer. One key issue is how to construct a training data set of low-contrast and high-contrast image pairs for end-to-end CNN learning. To this end, we build a large-scale multi-exposure image data set, which contains 589 elaborately selected high-resolution multi-exposure sequences with 4,413 images. Thirteen representative multi-exposure image fusion and stack-based high dynamic range imaging algorithms are employed to generate the contrast enhanced images for each sequence, and subjective experiments are conducted to screen the best quality one as the reference image of each scene. With the constructed data set, a CNN can be easily trained as the SICE enhancer to improve the contrast of an under-/over-exposure image. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing SICE methods with a significant margin.

AB Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death worldwide. Early diagnosis can effectively reduce the mortality, and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) as an important way to assist doctors has developed rapidly. In particular, automated pulmonary nodule detection in computed tomography (CT) images is crucial to CAD. It is a challenging task to quickly locate the exact positions of lung nodules. In this paper, a novel automated pulmonary nodule detection framework with 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to assist the CT reading process. Firstly, we adjust the structure of Faster R-CNN with two region proposal networks and a deconvolutional layer to detect nodule candidates, and then three models are trained for three kinds of slices for later result fusion. Secondly, a boosting architecture based on 2D CNN is designed for false positive reduction, which is a classifier to distinguish true nodules from the candidates. The misclassified samples are still kept for retraining a model which boosts the sensitivity for pulmonary nodule detection. Finally, the results of these networks are fused to vote out the final classification results. Extensive experiments are conducted on LUNA16, and the sensitivity of nodule candidate detection achieves 86.42%. For the false positive reduction, the sensitivity reaches 73.4% and 74.4% at 1/8 and 1/4 FPs/scan, respectively. It illustrates that the proposed method can obviously achieve accurate pulmonary nodule detection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) may be cured with radiation therapy. Tumor proximity to critical structures demands accuracy in tumor delineation to avoid toxicities from radiation therapy; however, tumor target contouring for head and neck radiation therapy is labor intensive and highly variable among radiation oncologists.
   Purpose: To construct and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) contouring tool to automate primary gross tumor volume (GTV) contouring in patients with NPC.
   Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, MRI data sets covering the nasopharynx from 1021 patients (median age, 47 years; 751 male, 270 female) with NPC between September 2016 and September 2017 were collected and divided into training, validation, and testing cohorts of 715, 103, and 203 patients, respectively. GTV contours were delineated for 1021 patients and were defined by consensus of two experts. A three-dimensional convolutional neural network was applied to 818 training and validation MRI data sets to construct the AI tool, which was tested in 203 independent MRI data sets. Next, the AI tool was compared against eight qualified radiation oncologists in a multicenter evaluation by using a random sample of 20 test MRI examinations. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used to compare the difference of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of pre-versus post-AI assistance.
   Results: The AI-generated contours demonstrated a high level of accuracy when compared with ground truth contours at testing in 203 patients (DSC, 0.79; 2.0-mm difference in average surface distance). In multicenter evaluation, AI assistance improved contouring accuracy (five of eight oncologists had a higher median DSC after AI assistance; average median DSC, 0.74 vs 0.78; P < .001), reduced intra-and interobserver variation (by 36.4% and 54.5%, respectively), and reduced contouring time (by 39.4%).
   Conclusion: The AI contouring tool improved primary gross tumor contouring accuracy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which could have a positive impact on tumor control and patient survival. (C) RSNA, 2019

AB In this brief, we establish a novel complex-valued memristive recurrent neural network (CVMRNN) to study its stability. As a generalization of real-valued memristive neural networks, CVMRNN can be separated into real and imaginary parts. By means of M-matrix and Lyapunov function, the existence, uniqueness, and exponential stability of the equilibrium point for CVMRNNs are investigated, and sufficient conditions are presented. Finally, the effectiveness of obtained results is illustrated by two numerical examples.

AB This paper introduces three machine learning (ML) algorithms, the 'ensemble' Random Forest (RF), the 'ensemble' Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT) and the MultiLayer Perceptron neural network (MLP) and applies them to the spatial modelling of shallow landslides near Kvam in Norway. In the development of the ML models, a total of 11 significant landslide controlling factors were selected. The controlling factors relate to the geomorphology, geology, geo-environment and anthropogenic effects: slope angle, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, flow accumulation, flow direction, distance to rivers, water content, saturation, rainfall and distance to roads. It is observed that slope angle was the most significant controlling factor in the ML analyses. The performance of the three ML models was evaluated quantitatively based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results show that the 'ensemble' GBRT machine learning model yielded the most promising results for the spatial prediction of shallow landslides, with a 95% probability of landslide detection and 87% prediction efficiency.

AB With the breakthroughs in deep learning, the recent years have witnessed a booming of artificial intelligence (AI) applications and services, spanning from personal assistant to recommendation systems to video/audio surveillance. More recently, with the proliferation of mobile computing and Internet of Things (IoT), billions of mobile and IoT devices are connected to the Internet, generating zillions bytes of data at the network edge. Driving by this trend, there is an urgent need to push the AI frontiers to the network edge so as to fully unleash the potential of the edge big data. To meet this demand, edge computing, an emerging paradigm that pushes computing tasks and services from the network core to the network edge, has been widely recognized as a promising solution. The resulted new interdiscipline, edge AI or edge intelligence (EI), is beginning to receive a tremendous amount of interest. However, research on EI is still in its infancy stage, and a dedicated venue for exchanging the recent advances of EI is highly desired by both the computer system and AI communities. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent research efforts on EI. Specifically, we first review the background and motivation for AI running at the network edge. We then provide an overview of the overarching architectures, frameworks, and emerging key technologies for deep learning model toward training/inference at the network edge. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities on EI. We believe that this survey will elicit escalating attentions, stimulate fruitful discussions, and inspire further research ideas on EI.

AB Product design is a highly involved, often ill-defined, complex and iterative process, and the needs and specifications of the required artifact get more refined only as the design process moves toward its goal. An effective computer support tool that helps the designer make better-informed decisions requires efficient knowledge representation schemes. In today's world, there is a virtual explosion in the amount of raw data available to the designer, and knowledge representation is critical in order to sift through this data and make sense of it. In addition, the need to stay competitive has shrunk product development time through the use of simultaneous and collaborative design processes, which depend on effective transfer of knowledge between teams. Finally, the awareness that decisions made early in the design process have a higher impact in terms of energy, cost, and sustainability, has resulted in the need to project knowledge typically required in the later stages of design to the earlier stages. Research in design rationale systems, product families, systems engineering, and ontology engineering has sought to capture knowledge from earlier product design decisions, from the breakdown of product functions and associated physical features, and from customer requirements and feedback reports. VR (Virtual reality) systems and multidisciplinary modeling have enabled the simulation of scenarios in the manufacture, assembly, and use of the product. This has helped capture vital knowledge from these stages of the product life and use it in design validation and testing. While there have been considerable and significant developments in knowledge capture and representation in product design, it is useful to sometimes review our position in the area, study the evolution of research in product design, and from past and current trends, try and foresee future developments. The goal of this paper is thus to review both our understanding of the field and the support tools that exist for the purpose, and identify the trends and possible directions research can evolve in the future.

AB Hyperspectral data classification is a hot topic in remote sensing community. In recent years, significant effort has been focused on this issue. However, most of the methods extract the features of original data in a shallow manner. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning approach into hyperspectral image classification. A new feature extraction (FE) and image classification framework are proposed for hyperspectral data analysis based on deep belief network (DBN). First, we verify the eligibility of restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and DBN by the following spectral information-based classification. Then, we propose a novel deep architecture, which combines the spectral-spatial FE and classification together to get high classification accuracy. The framework is a hybrid of principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical learning-based FE, and logistic regression (LR). Experimental results with hyperspectral data indicate that the classifier provide competitive solution with the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, this paper reveals that deep learning system has huge potential for hyperspectral data classification.

AB In this work, we aim to address the problem of human interaction recognition in videos by exploring the long-term inter-related dynamics among multiple persons. Recently, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has become a popular choice to model individual dynamic for single-person action recognition due to its ability to capture the temporal motion information in a range. However, most existing LSTM-based methods focus only on capturing the dynamics of human interaction by simply combining all dynamics of individuals or modeling them as a whole. Such methods neglect the inter-related dynamics of how human interactions change over time. To this end, we propose a novel Hierarchical Long Short-Term Concurrent Memory (H-LSTCM) to model the long-term inter-related dynamics among a group of persons for recognizing human interactions. Specifically, we first feed each person's static features into a Single-Person LSTM to model the single-person dynamic. Subsequently, at one time step, the outputs of all Single-Person LSTM units are fed into a novel Concurrent LSTM (Co-LSTM) unit, which mainly consists of multiple sub-memory units, a new cell gate, and a new co-memory cell. In the Co-LSTM unit, each sub-memory unit stores individual motion information, while this Co-LSTM unit selectively integrates and stores inter-related motion information between multiple interacting persons from multiple sub-memory units via the cell gate and co-memory cell, respectively. Extensive experiments on several public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed H-LSTCM by comparing against baseline and state-of-the-art methods.

TI Real-Time Human Pose Recognition in Parts from Single Depth Images
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
LA English
DT Article
AB We propose a new method to quickly and accurately - predict human pose-the 3D positions of body joints-from a single depth image, without depending on information from preceding frames. Our approach is strongly rooted in current object recognition strategies. By designing an intermediate - representation in terms of body parts, the difficult pose estimation problem is transformed into a simpler per-pixel classification problem, for which efficient machine learning techniques exist. By using computer graphics to synthesize a very large dataset of training image pairs, one can train a classifier that estimates body part labels from test images invariant to pose, body shape, clothing, and other irrelevances. Finally, we generate confidence-scored 3D proposals of several body joints by reprojecting the classification result and finding local modes.
   The system runs in under 5ms on the Xbox 360. Our evaluation shows high accuracy on both synthetic and real test sets, and investigates the effect of several training parameters. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in our comparison with related work and demonstrate improved generalization over exact whole-skeleton nearest neighbor matching.

AB Because of their outstanding electrical and mechanical properties, graphene strain sensors have attracted extensive attention for electronic applications in virtual reality, robotics, medical diagnostics, and healthcare. Although several strain sensors based on graphene have been reported, the stretchability and sensitivity of these sensors remain limited, and also there is a pressing need to develop a practical fabrication process. This paper reports the fabrication and characterization of new types of graphene strain sensors based on stretchable yarns. Highly stretchable, sensitive, and wearable sensors are realized by a layer-by-layer assembly method that is simple, low-cost, scalable, and solution-processable. Because of the yarn structures, these sensors exhibit high stretchability (up to 150%) and versatility, and can detect both large- and small-scale human motions. For this study, wearable electronics are fabricated with implanted sensors that can monitor diverse human motions, including joint movement, phonation, swallowing, and breathing.

TI EKT: Exercise-Aware Knowledge Tracing for Student Performance Prediction

AB For offering proactive services (e.g., personalized exercise recommendation) to the students in computer supported intelligent education, one of the fundamental tasks is predicting student performance (e.g., scores) on future exercises, where it is necessary to track the change of each student's knowledge acquisition during her exercising activities. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, existing approaches can only exploit the exercising records of students, and the problem of extracting rich information existed in the materials (e.g., knowledge concepts, exercise content) of exercises to achieve both more precise prediction of student performance and more interpretable analysis of knowledge acquisition remains underexplored. To this end, in this paper, we present a holistic study of student performance prediction. To directly achieve the primary goal of performance prediction, we first propose a general Exercise-Enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (EERNN) framework by exploring both student's exercising records and the text content of corresponding exercises. In EERNN, we simply summarize each student's state into an integrated vector and trace it with a recurrent neural network, where we design a bidirectional LSTM to learn the encoding of each exercise from its content. For making final predictions, we design two implementations on the basis of EERNN with different prediction strategies, i.e., EERNNM with Markov property and EERNNA with Attention mechanism. Then, to explicitly track student's knowledge acquisition on multiple knowledge concepts, we extend EERNN to an explainable Exercise-aware Knowledge Tracing (EKT) framework by incorporating the knowledge concept information, where the student's integrated state vector is now extended to a knowledge state matrix. In EKT, we further develop a memory network for quantifying how much each exercise can affect the mastery of students on multiple knowledge concepts during the exercising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and evaluate both EERNN and EKT frameworks on a largescale real-world data. The results in both general and cold-start scenarios clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of two frameworks in student performance prediction as well as the superior interpretability of EKT.

TI Recurrent Neural Networks for Multivariate Time Series with Missing

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID IMPUTATION
AB Multivariate time series data in practical applications, such as health care, geoscience, and biology, are characterized by a variety of missing values. In time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels, a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance. In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provide useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis.

AB End-to-end learning of communications systems is a fascinating novel concept that has so far only been validated by simulations for block-based transmissions. It allows learning of transmitter and receiver implementations as deep neural networks (NNs) that are optimized for an arbitrary differentiable end-to-end performance metric, e.g., block error rate (BLER). In this paper, we demonstrate that over-the-air transmissions are possible: We build, train, and run a complete communications system solely composed of NNs using unsynchronized off-the-shelf software-defined radios and open-source deep learning software libraries. We extend the existing ideas toward continuous data transmission, which eases their current restriction to short block lengths but also entails the issue of receiver synchronization. We overcome this problem by introducing a frame synchronization module based on another NN. A comparison of the BLER performance of the "learned" system with that of a practical baseline shows competitive performance close to 1 dB, even without extensive hyperparameter tuning. We identify several practical challenges of training such a system over actual channels, in particular, the missing channel gradient, and propose a two-step learning procedure based on the idea of transfer learning that circumvents this issue.

AB The abundant spatial and contextual information provided by the advanced remote sensing technology has facilitated subsequent automatic interpretation of the optical remote sensing images (RSIs). In this paper, a novel and effective geospatial object detection framework is proposed by combining the weakly supervised learning (WSL) and high-level feature learning. First, deep Boltzmann machine is adopted to infer the spatial and structural information encoded in the low-level and middle-level features to effectively describe objects in optical RSIs. Then, a novel WSL approach is presented to object detection where the training sets require only binary labels indicating whether an image contains the target object or not. Based on the learnt high-level features, it jointly integrates saliency, intraclass compactness, and interclass separability in a Bayesian framework to initialize a set of training examples from weakly labeled images and start iterative learning of the object detector. A novel evaluation criterion is also developed to detect model drift and cease the iterative learning. Comprehensive experiments on three optical RSI data sets have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed approach in bench-marking with several state-of-the-art supervised-learning-based object detection approaches.

AB We introduce a scheme for molecular simulations, the deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) method, based on a many-body potential and interatomic forces generated by a carefully crafted deep neural network trained with ab initio data. The neural network model preserves all the natural symmetries in the problem. It is first-principles based in the sense that there are no ad hoc components aside from the network model. We show that the proposed scheme provides an efficient and accurate protocol in a variety of systems, including bulk materials and molecules. In all these cases, DPMD gives results that are essentially indistinguishable from the original data, at a cost that scales linearly with system size.

AB Deep learning is quickly becoming one of the most important tools for image classification. This technology is now beginning to be applied to the tasks of plant disease classification and recognition. The positive results that are being obtained using this approach hide some issues that are seldom taken into account in the respective experiments. This article presents an investigation into the main factors that affect the design and effectiveness of deep neural nets applied to plant pathology. An in-depth analysis of the subject, in which advantages and shortcomings are highlighted, should lead to more realistic conclusions on the subject. The arguments used throughout the text are built upon both studies found in the literature and experiments carried out using an image database carefully built to reflect and reproduce many of the conditions expected to be found in practice.

ID TRAJECTORY OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN
AB Legged robots pose one of the greatest challenges in robotics. Dynamic and agile maneuvers of animals cannot be imitated by existing methods that are crafted by humans. A compelling alternative is reinforcement learning, which requires minimal craftsmanship and promotes the natural evolution of a control policy. However, so far, reinforcement learning research for legged robots is mainly limited to simulation, and only few and comparably simple examples have been deployed on real systems. The primary reason is that training with real robots, particularly with dynamically balancing systems, is complicated and expensive. In the present work, we introduce a method for training a neural network policy in simulation and transferring it to a state-of-the-art legged system, thereby leveraging fast, automated, and cost-effective data generation schemes. The approach is applied to the ANYmaI robot, a sophisticated medium-dog-sized quadrupedal system. Using policies trained in simulation, the quadrupedal machine achieves locomotion skills that go beyond what had been achieved with prior methods: ANYmaI is capable of precisely and energy-efficiently following high-level body velocity commands, running faster than before, and recovering from falling even in complex configurations.

AB Automated skin lesion classification in dermoscopy images is an essential way to improve the diagnostic performance and reduce melanoma deaths. Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have made dramatic breakthroughs in many image classification tasks, accurate classification of skin lesions remains challenging due to the insufficiency of training data, inter-class similarity, intra-class variation, and the lack of the ability to focus on semantically meaningful lesion parts. To address these issues, we propose an attention residual learning convolutional neural network (ARL-CNN) model for skin lesion classification in dermoscopy images, which is composed of multiple ARL blocks, a global average pooling layer, and a classification layer. Each ARL block jointly uses the residual learning and a novel attention learning mechanisms to improve its ability for discriminative representation. Instead of using extra learnable layers, the proposed attention learning mechanism aims to exploit the intrinsic self-attention ability of DCNNs, i.e., using the feature maps learned by a high layer to generate the attention map for a low layer. We evaluated our ARL-CNN model on the ISIC-skin 2017 dataset. Our results indicate that the proposed ARL-CNN model can adaptively focus on the discriminative parts of skin lesions, and thus achieve the state-of-the-art performance in skin lesion classification.

AB The attitude control of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is investigated. The aim of this paper is to develop a continuous multivariable attitude control law, which drives the attitude tracking errors of quadrotor UAV to zero in finite time. First, a multivariable super-twisting-like algorithm (STLA) is proposed for arbitrary order integrator systems subject to matched disturbances. A discontinuous integral term is incorporated in the control law in order to compensate the disturbances. A rigorous proof of the finite time stability of the close-loop system is derived by utilizing the Lyapunov method and the homogeneous technique. Then, the implementation of the developed method in an indoor quadrotor UAV is performed. The remarkable features of the developed algorithm includes the finite time convergence, the chattering suppression and the nominal performance recovery. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations and experimental verification.

AB This paper presents a novel asymptotic tracking controller for an underactuated quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle using the robust integral of the signum of the error (RISE) method and an immersion and invariance (I&I)-based adaptive control methodology. The control system is decoupled into two parts: the inner loop for attitude control and the outer loop for position control. The RISE approach is applied in the inner loop for disturbance rejection, whereas the I&I approach is chosen for the outer loop to compensate for the parametric uncertainties. The asymptotic tracking of the time-varying 3-D position and the yaw motion reference trajectories is proven via the Lyapunov-based stability analysis and LaSalle's invariance theorem. Real-time experiment results, which are performed on a hardware-in-the-loop simulation testbed, are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control scheme.

AB Echo state network (ESN) is a fast recurrent neural network with remarkable generalization performance for intelligent diagnosis of machinery faults. When dealing with high-dimensional signals mixed with much noise, however, the performance of a deep ESN is still highly affected by the random selection of input weights and reservoir weights, resulting in the optimal design of the deep ESN architecture, which is an open issue. For this reason, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm featuring a competitive swarm optimizer combined with a local search is proposed in this article. An indirect encoding method is designed based on the network characteristics of ESN to make the evolutionary process computationally economical. A layerwise optimization strategy is subsequently introduced for evolving deep ESNs. The results of two experimental cases show that the proposed approach has promising performance in identifying different faults reliably and accurately by comparing with other intelligent fault diagnosis approaches.

AB Background The performance of left ventricular (LV) functional assessment using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) relies on the accuracy of segmentation. Current methods require manual adjustments that are tedious and subjective. We propose a novel machine-learning-based method to automatically segment LV myocardium and measure its volume in gated MPS imaging without human intervention. Methods We used an end-to-end fully convolutional neural network to segment LV myocardium by delineating its endocardial and epicardial surface. A novel compound loss function, which encourages similarity and penalizes discrepancy between prediction and training dataset, is utilized in training stage to achieve excellent performance. We retrospectively investigated 32 normal patients and 24 abnormal patients, whose LV myocardial contours automatically segmented by our method were compared with those delineated by physicians as the ground truth. Results The results of our method demonstrated very good agreement with the ground truth. The average DSC metrics and Hausdorff distance of the contours delineated by our method are larger than 0.900 and less than 1 cm, respectively, among all 32 + 24 patients of all phases. The correlation coefficient of the LV myocardium volume between ground truth and our results is 0.910 +/- 0.061 (P < 0.001), and the mean relative error of LV myocardium volume is - 1.09 +/- 3.66%. Conclusion These results strongly indicate the feasibility of our method in accurately quantifying LV myocardium volume change over the cardiac cycle. The learning-based segmentation method in gated MPS imaging has great promise for clinical use.

DT Article
AB The 2010 i2b2/VA Workshop on Natural Language Processing Challenges for Clinical Records presented three tasks: a concept extraction task focused on the extraction of medical concepts from patient reports; an assertion classification task focused on assigning assertion types for medical problem concepts; and a relation classification task focused on assigning relation types that hold between medical problems, tests, and treatments. i2b2 and the VA provided an annotated reference standard corpus for the three tasks. Using this reference standard, 22 systems were developed for concept extraction, 21 for assertion classification, and 16 for relation classification. These systems showed that machine learning approaches could be augmented with rule-based systems to determine concepts, assertions, and relations. Depending on the task, the rule-based systems can either provide input for machine learning or post-process the output of machine learning. Ensembles of classifiers, information from unlabeled data, and external knowledge sources can help when the training data are inadequate.

AB By considering the spectral signature as a sequence, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been successfully used to learn discriminative features from hyperspectral images (HSIs) recently. However, most of these models only input the whole spectral bands into RNNs directly, which may not fully explore the specific properties of HSIs. In this paper, we propose a cascaded RNN model using gated recurrent units to explore the redundant and complementary information of HSIs. It mainly consists of two RNN layers. The first RNN layer is used to eliminate redundant information between adjacent spectral bands, while the second RNN layer aims to learn the complementary information from nonadjacent spectral bands. To improve the discriminative ability of the learned features, we design two strategies for the proposed model. Besides, considering the rich spatial information contained in HSIs, we further extend the proposed model to its spectral- spatial counterpart by incorporating some convolutional layers. To test the effectiveness of our proposed models, we conduct experiments on two widely used HSIs. The experimental results show that our proposed models can achieve better results than the compared models.

AB In future mobile networks, it is difficult for static base stations (BSs) to support the rapidly increasing data services, especially for cell-edge users. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising method that can assist BSs to offload the data traffic, due to its high mobility and flexibility. In this correspondence, we focus on the UAV trajectory at the edges of three adjacent cells to offload traffic for BSs. In the proposed scheme, the sum rate of UAV-served edge users is maximized subject to the rate requirements for all the users, by optimizing the UAV trajectory in each flying cycle. The optimization is a mixed-integer nonconvex problem, which is difficult to solve. Thus, it is transformed into two convex problems, and an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve it by optimizing the UAV trajectory and edge user scheduling alternately. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Formation control analysis and design problems for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm systems to achieve time-varying formations are investigated. To achieve predefined timevarying formations, formation protocols are presented for UAV swarm systems first, where the velocities of UAVs can be different when achieving formations. Then, consensus-based approaches are applied to deal with the time-varying formation control problems for UAV swarm systems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for UAV swarm systems to achieve time-varying formations are proposed. An explicit expression of the timevarying formation center function is derived. In addition, a procedure to design the protocol for UAV swarm systems to achieve time-varying formations is given. Finally, a quadrotor formation platform, which consists of five quadrotors is introduced. Theoretical results obtained in this brief are validated on the quardrotor formation platform, and outdoor experimental results are presented.

AB In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of class imbalance on classification performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and compare frequently used methods to address the issue. Class imbalance is a common problem that has been comprehensively studied in classical machine learning, yet very limited systematic research is available in the context of deep learning. In our study, we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities. Our main evaluation metric is area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) adjusted to multi-class tasks since overall accuracy metric is associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data. Based on results from our experiments we conclude that (i) the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is detrimental; (ii) the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed scenarios was oversampling; (iii) oversampling should be applied to the level that completely eliminates the imbalance, whereas the optimal undersampling ratio depends on the extent of imbalance; (iv) as opposed to some classical machine learning models, oversampling does not cause overfitting of CNNs; (v) thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class probabilities when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest.

   RELIABILITY; DISCOURSE; VALIDITY
AB Language and speech are the primary source of data for psychiatrists to diagnose and treat mental disorders. In psychosis, the very structure of language can be disturbed, including semantic coherence (e.g., derailment and tangentiality) and syntactic complexity (e.g., concreteness). Subtle disturbances in language are evident in schizophrenia even prior to first psychosis onset, during prodromal stages. Using computer-based natural language processing analyses, we previously showed that, among English-speaking clinical (e.g., ultra) high-risk youths, baseline reduction in semantic coherence (the flow of meaning in speech) and in syntactic complexity could predict subsequent psychosis onset with high accuracy. Herein, we aimed to cross-validate these automated linguistic analytic methods in a second larger risk cohort, also English-speaking, and to discriminate speech in psychosis from normal speech. We identified an automated machine-learning speech classifier - comprising decreased semantic coherence, greater variance in that coherence, and reduced usage of possessive pronouns - that had an 83% accuracy in predicting psychosis onset (intra-protocol), a cross-validated accuracy of 79% of psychosis onset prediction in the original risk cohort (cross-protocol), and a 72% accuracy in discriminating the speech of recent-onset psychosis patients from that of healthy individuals. The classifier was highly correlated with previously identified manual linguistic predictors. Our findings support the utility and validity of automated natural language processing methods to characterize disturbances in semantics and syntax across stages of psychotic disorder. The next steps will be to apply these methods in larger risk cohorts to further test reproducibility, also in languages other than English, and identify sources of variability. This technology has the potential to improve prediction of psychosis outcome among at-risk youths and identify linguistic targets for remediation and preventive intervention. More broadly, automated linguistic analysis can be a powerful tool for diagnosis and treatment across neuropsychiatry.

AB A novel artificial intelligence approach of Bayesian Logistic Regression (BLR) and its ensembles [Random Subspace (RS), Adaboost (AB), Multiboost (MB) and Bagging] was introduced for landslide susceptibility mapping in a part of Kamyaran city in Kurdistan Province, Iran. A spatial database was generated which includes a total of 60 landslide locations and a set of conditioning factors tested by the Information Gain Ratio technique. Performance of these models was evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and statistical index-based methods. Results showed that the hybrid ensemble models could significantly improve the performance of the base classifier of BLR (AUROC?=?0.930). However, RS model (AUROC?=?0.975) had the highest performance in comparison to other landslide ensemble models, followed by Bagging (AUROC?=?0.972), MB (AUROC?=?0.970) and AB (AUROC?=?0.957) models, respectively.

AB Human action recognition in 3D skeleton sequences has attracted a lot of research attention. Recently, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks have shown promising performance in this task due to their strengths in modeling the dependencies and dynamics in sequential data. As not all skeletal joints are informative for action recognition, and the irrelevant joints often bring noise which can degrade the performance, we need to pay more attention to the informative ones. However, the original LSTM network does not have explicit attention ability. In this paper, we propose a new class of LSTM network, global context-aware attention LSTM, for skeleton-based action recognition, which is capable of selectively focusing on the informative joints in each frame by using a global context memory cell. To further improve the attention capability, we also introduce a recurrent attention mechanism, with which the attention performance of our network can be enhanced progressively. Besides, a two-stream framework, which leverages coarse-grained attention and fine-grained attention, is also introduced. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging datasets for skeleton-based action recognition.

AB Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) plays an important role in solving many fundamental problems in video analysis and computer vision. Most MOT methods employ two steps: Object Detection and Data Association. The first step detects objects of interest in every frame of a video, and the second establishes correspondence between the detected objects in different frames to obtain their tracks. Object detection has made tremendous progress in the last few years due to deep learning. However, data association for tracking still relies on hand crafted constraints such as appearance, motion, spatial proximity, grouping etc. to compute affinities between the objects in different frames. In this paper, we harness the power of deep learning for data association in tracking by jointly modeling object appearances and their affinities between different frames in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed Deep Affinity Network (DAN) learns compact, yet comprehensive features of pre-detected objects at several levels of abstraction, and performs exhaustive pairing permutations of those features in any two frames to infer object affinities. DAN also accounts for multiple objects appearing and disappearing between video frames. We exploit the resulting efficient affinity computations to associate objects in the current frame deep into the previous frames for reliable on-line tracking. Our technique is evaluated on popular multiple object tracking challenges MOT15, MOT17 and UA-DETRAC. Comprehensive benchmarking under twelve evaluation metrics demonstrates that our approach is among the best performing techniques on the leader board for these challenges. The open source implementation of our work is available at https://github.com/shijieS/SST.git.

AB This paper provides a review and commentary on the past, present, and future of numerical optimization algorithms in the context of machine learning applications. Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations.

AB Innovative approaches and tools play an important role in shaping design, characterization and optimization for the field of photonics. As a subset of machine learning that learns multilevel abstraction of data using hierarchically structured layers, deep learning offers an efficient means to design photonic structures, spawning data-driven approaches complementary to conventional physics- and rule-based methods. Here, we review recent progress in deep-learning-based photonic design by providing the historical background, algorithm fundamentals and key applications, with the emphasis on various model architectures for specific photonic tasks. We also comment on the challenges and perspectives of this emerging research direction.

AB Sustainability labels are important tools that help consumers assess the sustainability aspects of food. While past studies have focused on visual attention to nutrition information, no study has investigated the visual attention paid by consumers to the sustainability information on food. Our study contributes to the need to better understand consumers' attention to sustainability information when making food choices. The objective was to explore the importance that consumers attach to sustainability attributes and investigate how this relates to the visual attention paid to these attributes during the choice decision and to willingness-to-pay (WTP). Visual attention during the decision making process was measured in terms of fixation time and fixation count, which were then analyzed in relation to the stated attribute importance. Our results suggest that consumer segments with differences in stated attribute importance, visually attend differently to these attributes. Higher valued attributes also exhibited higher visual attention. Our results suggest that consumers who spend more time attending to and fixate more on sustainability attributes value them more.

AB Epithelial (EP) and stromal (ST) are two types of tissues in histological images. Automated segmentation or classification of EP and ST tissues is important when developing computerized system for analyzing the tumor microenvironment. In this paper, a Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) based feature learning is presented to automatically segment or classify EP and ST regions from digitized tumor tissue microarrays (TMAs). Current approaches are based on handcraft feature representation, such as color, texture, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) in classifying two regions. Compared to handcrafted feature based approaches, which involve task dependent representation, DCNN is an end-to-end feature extractor that may be directly learned from the raw pixel intensity value of EP and ST tissues in a data driven fashion. These high-level features contribute to the construction of a supervised classifier for discriminating the two types of tissues. In this work we compare DCNN based models with three handcraft feature extraction based approaches on two different datasets which consist of 157 Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images of breast cancer and 1376 immunohistological (IHC) stained images of colorectal cancer, respectively. The DCNN based feature learning approach was shown to have a Fl classification score of 85%, 89%, and 100%, accuracy (ACC) of 84%, 88%, and 100%, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 86%, 77%, and 100% on two H&E stained (NKI and VGH) and IHC stained data, respectively. Our DNN based approach was shown to outperform three handcraft feature extraction based approaches in terms of the classification of EP and ST regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Measuring the Objectness of Image Windows
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Objectness measure; object detection; object recognition
AB We present a generic objectness measure, quantifying how likely it is for an image window to contain an object of any class. We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. These include an innovative cue to measure the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure, and the combined objectness measure to perform better than any cue alone. We also compare to interest point operators, a HOG detector, and three recent works aiming at automatic object segmentation. Finally, we present two applications of objectness. In the first, we sample a small numberof windows according to their objectness probability and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. As we show experimentally, this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by the expensive class-specific model. In the second application, we use objectness as a complementary score in addition to the class-specific model, which leads to fewer false positives. As shown in several recent papers, objectness can act as a valuable focus of attention mechanism in many other applications operating on image windows, including weakly supervised learning of object categories, unsupervised pixelwise segmentation, and object tracking in video. Computing objectness is very efficient and takes only about 4 sec. per image.

AB Objectives Deep learning reconstruction (DLR) is a new reconstruction method; it introduces deep convolutional neural networks into the reconstruction flow. This study was conducted in order to examine the clinical applicability of abdominal ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT) exams reconstructed with a new DLR in comparison to hybrid and model-based iterative reconstruction (hybrid-IR, MBIR). Methods Our retrospective study included 46 patients seen between December 2017 and April 2018. A radiologist recorded the standard deviation of attenuation in the paraspinal muscle as the image noise and calculated the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the aorta, portal vein, and liver. The overall image quality was assessed by two other radiologists and graded on a 5-point confidence scale ranging from 1 (unacceptable) to 5 (excellent). The difference between CT images subjected to hybrid-IR, MBIR, and DLR was compared. Results The image noise was significantly lower and the CNR was significantly higher on DLR than hybrid-IR and MBIR images (p < 0.01). DLR images received the highest and MBIR images the lowest scores for overall image quality. Conclusions DLR improved the quality of abdominal U-HRCT images.

AB Infrared and visible images are a pair of multi-source multi-sensors images. However, the infrared images lack structural details and visible images are impressionable to the imaging environment. To fully utilize the meaningful information of the infrared and visible images, a practical fusion method, termed as RCGAN, is proposed in this paper. In RCGAN, we introduce a pioneering use of the coupled generative adversarial network to the field of image fusion. Moreover, the simple yet efficient relativistic discriminator is applied to our network. By doing so, the network converges faster. More importantly, different from the previous works in which the label for generator is either infrared image or visible image, we innovatively put forward a strategy to use a pre-fused image as the label. This is a technical innovation, which makes the process of generating fused images no longer out of thin air, but from existence to excellent.d The extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed RCGAN can produce a faithful fused image, which can efficiently persevere the rich texture from visible images and thermal radiation information from infrared images. Compared with traditional methods, it successfully avoids the complex manual designed fusion rules, and also shows a clear advantages over other deep learning-based fusion methods.

AB Hashing methods for efficient image retrieval aim at learning hash functions that map similar images to semantically correlated binary codes in the Hamming space with similarity well preserved. The traditional hashing methods usually represent image content by hand-crafted features. Deep hashing methods based on deep neural network (DNN) architectures can generate more effective image features and obtain better retrieval performance. However, the underlying data structure is hardly captured by existing DNN models. Moreover, the similarity (either visually or semantically) between pairwise images is ambiguous, even uncertain, to be measured in the existing deep hashing methods. In this article, we propose a novel hashing method termed deep fuzzy hashing network (DFHN) to overcome the shortcomings of existing deep hashing approaches. Our DFHN method combines the fuzzy logic technique and the DNN to learn more effective binary codes, which can leverage fuzzy rules to model the uncertainties underlying the data. Derived from fuzzy logic theory, the generalized hamming distance is devised in the convolutional layers and fully connected layers in our DFHN to model their outputs, which come from an efficient xor operation on given inputs and weights. Extensive experiments show that our DFHN method obtains competitive retrieval accuracy with highly efficient training speed compared with several state-of-the-art deep hashing approaches on two large-scale image datasets: CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE.

AB The problem of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) consists in following the trajectory of different objects in a sequence, usually a video. In recent years, with the rise of Deep Learning, the algorithms that provide a solution to this problem have benefited from the representational power of deep models. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on works that employ Deep Learning models to solve the task of MOT on single-camera videos. Four main steps in MOT algorithms are identified, and an in-depth review of how Deep Learning was employed in each one of these stages is presented. A complete experimental comparison of the presented works on the three MOTChallenge datasets is also provided, identifying a number of similarities among the top-performing methods and presenting some possible future research directions.

AB Purpose: To develop a deep learning (DL) algorithm to assess mammographic breast density.
   Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a deep convolutional neural network was trained to assess Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density based on the original interpretation by an experienced radiologist of 41 479 digital screening mammograms obtained in 27 684 women from January 2009 to May 2011. The resulting algorithm was tested on a held-out test set of 8677 mammograms in 5741 women. In addition, five radiologists performed a reader study on 500 mammograms randomly selected from the test set. Finally, the algorithm was implemented in routine clinical practice, where eight radiologists reviewed 10 763 consecutive mammograms assessed with the model. Agreement on BI-RADS category for the DL model and for three sets of readings-(a) radiologists in the test set, (b) radiologists working in consensus in the reader study set, and (c) radiologists in the clinical implementation set-were estimated with linear-weighted k statistics and were compared across 5000 bootstrap samples to assess significance.
   Results: The DL model showed good agreement with radiologists in the test set (kappa = 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.68) and with radiologists in consensus in the reader study set (kappa = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.73, 0.82). There was very good agreement (kappa = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.86) with radiologists in the clinical implementation set; for binary categorization of dense or nondense breasts, 10 149 of 10 763 (94%; 95% CI: 94%, 95%) DL assessments were accepted by the interpreting radiologist.
   Conclusion: This DL model can be used to assess mammographic breast density at the level of an experienced mammographer. (c) RSNA, 2018

AB Pathological evaluation of tumor tissue is pivotal for diagnosis in cancer patients and automated image analysis approaches have great potential to increase precision of diagnosis and help reduce human error. In this study, we utilize several computational methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) and build a stand-alone pipeline to effectively classify different histopathology images across different types of cancer.
   In particular, we demonstrate the utility of our pipeline to discriminate between two subtypes of lung cancer, four biomarkers of bladder cancer, and five biomarkers of breast cancer. In addition, we apply our pipeline to discriminate among four immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining scores of bladder and breast cancers.
   Our classification pipeline includes a basic CNN architecture, Google's Inceptions with three training strategies, and an ensemble of two state-of-the-art algorithms, Inception and ResNet. Training strategies include training the last layer of Google's Inceptions, training the network from scratch, and fine-tunning the parameters for our data using two pre-trained version of Google's Inception architectures, Inception-V1 and Inception-V3.
   We demonstrate the power of deep learning approaches for identifying cancer subtypes, and the robustness of Google's Inceptions even in presence of extensive tumor heterogeneity. On average, our pipeline achieved accuracies of 100%, 92%, 95%, and 69% for discrimination of various cancer tissues, subtypes, biomarkers, and scores, respectively.

AB Recently, collaborative representation classification (CRC) has attracted much attention for hyperspectral image analysis. In particular, tangent space CRC (TCRC) has achieved excellent performance for hyperspectral image classification in a simplified tangent space. In this article, novel Bagging-based TCRC (TCRC-bagging) and Boosting-based TCRC (TCRC-boosting) methods are proposed. The main idea of TCRC-bagging is to generate diverse TCRC classification results using the bootstrap sample method, which can enhance the accuracy and diversity of a single classifier simultaneously. For TCRC-boosting, it can provide the most informative training samples by changing their distributions dynamically for each base TCRC learner. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated using three real hyperspectral data sets. The experimental results show that both TCRC-bagging and TCRC-boosting outperform their single classifier counterpart. In particular, the TCRC-boosting provides superior performance compared with the TCRC-bagging.

AB Formulation of speech separation as a supervised learning problem has shown considerable promise. In its simplest form, a supervised learning algorithm, typically a deep neural network, is trained to learn a mapping from noisy features to a time-frequency representation of the target of interest. Traditionally, the ideal binary mask (IBM) is used as the target because of its simplicity and large speech intelligibility gains. The supervised learning framework, however, is not restricted to the use of binary targets. In this study, we evaluate and compare separation results by using different training targets, including the IBM, the target binary mask, the ideal ratio mask (IRM), the short-time Fourier transform spectral magnitude and its corresponding mask (FFT-MASK), and the Gammatone frequency power spectrum. Our results in various test conditions reveal that the two ratio mask targets, the IRM and the FFT-MASK, outperform the other targets in terms of objective intelligibility and quality metrics. In addition, we find that masking based targets, in general, are significantly better than spectral envelope based targets. We also present comparisons with recent methods in non-negative matrix factorization and speech enhancement, which show clear performance advantages of supervised speech separation.

AB This paper synthesizes multiple methods for machine learning (ML) model interpretation and visualization (MIV) focusing on meteorological applications. ML has recently exploded in popularity in many fields, including meteorology. Although ML has been successful in meteorology, it has not been as widely accepted, primarily due to the perception that ML models are "black boxes," meaning the ML methods are thought to take inputs and provide outputs but not to yield physically interpretable information to the user. This paper introduces and demonstrates multiple MIV techniques for both traditional ML and deep learning, to enable meteorologists to understand what ML models have learned. We discuss permutation-based predictor importance, forward and backward selection, saliency maps, class-activation maps, backward optimization, and novelty detection. We apply these methods at multiple spatiotemporal scales to tornado, hail, winter precipitation type, and convective-storm mode. By analyzing such a wide variety of applications, we intend for this work to demystify the black box of ML, offer insight in applying MIV techniques, and serve as a MIV toolbox for meteorologists and other physical scientists.

AB High-dimensional data analysis is a challenge for researchers and engineers in the fields of machine learning and data mining. Feature selection provides an effective way to solve this problem by removing irrelevant and redundant data, which can reduce computation time, improve learning accuracy, and facilitate a better understanding for the learning model or data. In this study, we discuss several frequentlyused evaluation measures for feature selection, and then survey supervised, unsupervised, and semisupervised feature selection methods, which are widely applied in machine learning problems, such as classification and clustering. Lastly, future challenges about feature selection are discussed.

AB In this paper, a new interference-tolerant fast convergence zeroing neural network (ITFCZNN) using a novel activation function (NAF) for solving dynamic matrix inversion (DMI) is presented and investigated. Compared with the original zeroing neural network (OZNN) models, the proposed ITFCZNN not only has the ability to converge to 0 within a fixed-time, but also resist different types of interference and noises in solving DMI problems. Besides, detailed mathematical analysis of convergence and robustness of the ITFCZNN are provided. Comparative numerical simulation verifications of the new ITFCZNN and the OZNN activated by other commonly used activation functions (AF) are also provided to demonstrate the better robustness, effectiveness and fixed-time convergence of the ITFCZNN. In addition, a mobile manipulator path tracking application example is given to verify the applicability and feasibility of the ITFCZNN with interference and noises. Both of the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the ITFCZNN model. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB The price forecasting of the digital currencies in the financial market is of great importance, especially after the recent global economic crises. Due to the nonlinear dynamics, which is including inherent fractality and chaoticity of the digital currencies, it is understood from the research conducted by many researchers that a single model is not sufficient in forecasting the digital currencies with very high accuracy. Since the single models used in the forecasting of digital currencies have weaknesses as well as their own strengths, they might not grant the best forecasting achievement in all situations for all the time. A new hybrid-forecasting framework has been proposed in digital currency time-series to minimize this negative situation and increase forecasting achievement. In this study, a novel hybrid forecasting model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and empirical wavelet transform (EWT) decomposition along with cuckoo search (CS) algorithm is developed for digital currency time series. The model is obtained by combining the LSTM neural network and EWT decomposition technique, and optimizing the intrinsic mode function (IMF) estimated outputs with CS. The price of the four most traded digital currencies such as BTC, XRP, DASH and LTC, is estimated by the proposed model and the performance of the model has been tested. The experimental results show that the hybrid model proposed for digital currency forecasting can capture nonlinear properties of digital currency time series. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we focus on tackling the problem of automatic semantic annotation of high resolution (HR) optical satellite images, which aims to assign one or several predefined semantic concepts to an image according to its content. The main challenges arise from the difficulty of characterizing complex and ambiguous contents of the satellite images and the high human labor cost caused by preparing a large amount of training examples with high-quality pixel-level labels in fully supervised annotation methods. To address these challenges, we propose a unified annotation framework by combining discriminative high-level feature learning and weakly supervised feature transferring. Specifically, an efficient stacked discriminative sparse autoencoder (SDSAE) is first proposed to learn high-level features on an auxiliary satellite image data set for the land-use classification task. Inspired by the motivation that the encoder of the prelearned SDSAE can be regarded as a generic high-level feature extractor for HR optical satellite images, we then transfer the learned high-level features to semantic annotation. To compensate the difference between the auxiliary data set and the annotation data set, the transferred high-level features are further fine-tuned in a weakly supervised scheme by using the tile-level annotated training data. Finally, the fine-tuning process is formulated as an ultimate optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently with our proposed alternate iterative optimization method. Comprehensive experiments on a publicly available land-use classification data set and an annotation data set demonstrate the superiority of our SDSAE-based high-level feature learning method and the effectiveness of our weakly supervised semantic annotation framework compared with state-of-the-art fully supervised annotation methods.

ID WIRELESS NETWORKS; OPTIMIZATION
AB In this paper, the deployment of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a flying base station used to provide the fly wireless communications to a given geographical area is analyzed. In particular, the coexistence between the UAV, that is transmitting data in the downlink, and an underlaid device-to-device (D2D) communication network is considered. For this model, a tractable analytical framework for the coverage and rate analysis is derived. Two scenarios are considered: a static UAV and a mobile UAV. In the first scenario, the average coverage probability and the system sum-rate for the users in the area are derived as a function of the UAV altitude and the number of D2D users. In the second scenario, using the disk covering problem, the minimum number of stop points that the UAV needs to visit in order to completely cover the area is computed. Furthermore, considering multiple retransmissions for the UAV and D2D users, the overall outage probability of the D2D users is derived. Simulation and analytical results show that, depending on the density of D2D users, the optimal values for the UAV altitude, which lead to the maximum system sum-rate and coverage probability, exist. Moreover, our results also show that, by enabling the UAV to intelligently move over the target area, the total required transmit power of UAV while covering the entire area, can be minimized. Finally, in order to provide full coverage for the area of interest, the tradeoff between the coverage and delay, in terms of the number of stop points, is discussed.

AB Objective: A technical expert panel convened by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institute of Mental Health was charged with reviewing the state of research on behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) in mental health and identifying the top research priorities. BITs refers to behavioral and psychological interventions that use information and communication technology features to address behavioral and mental health outcomes.
   Method: This study on the findings of the technical expert panel.
   Results: Videoconferencing and standard telephone technologies to deliver psychotherapy have been well validated. Web-based interventions have shown efficacy across a broad range of mental health outcomes. Social media such as online support groups have produced disappointing outcomes when used alone. Mobile technologies have received limited attention for mental health outcomes. Virtual reality has shown good efficacy for anxiety and pediatric disorders. Serious gaming has received little work in mental health.
   Conclusion: Research focused on understanding reach, adherence, barriers and cost is recommended. Improvements in the collection, storage, analysis and visualization of big data will be required. New theoretical models and evaluation strategies will be required. Finally, for BITs to have a public health impact, research on implementation and application to prevention is required.

AB Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, which are highly complex to model. The research on the advancement of flood prediction models contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion, minimization of the loss of human life, and reduction of the property damage associated with floods. To mimic the complex mathematical expressions of physical processes of floods, during the past two decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly in the advancement of prediction systems providing better performance and cost-effective solutions. Due to the vast benefits and potential of ML, its popularity dramatically increased among hydrologists. Researchers through introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of the existing ones aim at discovering more accurate and efficient prediction models. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the state of the art of ML models in flood prediction and to give insight into the most suitable models. In this paper, the literature where ML models were benchmarked through a qualitative analysis of robustness, accuracy, effectiveness, and speed are particularly investigated to provide an extensive overview on the various ML algorithms used in the field. The performance comparison of ML models presents an in-depth understanding of the different techniques within the framework of a comprehensive evaluation and discussion. As a result, this paper introduces the most promising prediction methods for both long-term and short-term floods. Furthermore, the major trends in improving the quality of the flood prediction models are investigated. Among them, hybridization, data decomposition, algorithm ensemble, and model optimization are reported as the most effective strategies for the improvement of ML methods. This survey can be used as a guideline for hydrologists as well as climate scientists in choosing the proper ML method according to the prediction task.

AB We present a deep convolutional neural network for breast cancer screening exam classification, trained, and evaluated on over 200000 exams (over 1000000 images). Our network achieves an AUC of 0.895 in predicting the presence of cancer in the breast, when tested on the screening population. We attribute the high accuracy to a few technical advances. 1) Our network 2019;s novel two-stage architecture and training procedure, which allows us to use a high-capacity patch-level network to learn from pixel-level labels alongside a network learning from macroscopic breast-level labels. 2) A custom ResNet-based network used as a building block of our model, whose balance of depth and width is optimized for high-resolution medical images. 3) Pretraining the network on screening BI-RADS classification, a related task with more noisy labels. 4) Combining multiple input views in an optimal way among a number of possible choices. To validate our model, we conducted a reader study with 14 readers, each reading 720 screening mammogram exams, and show that our model is as accurate as experienced radiologists when presented with the same data. We also show that a hybrid model, averaging the probability of malignancy predicted by a radiologist with a prediction of our neural network, is more accurate than either of the two separately. To further understand our results, we conduct a thorough analysis of our network 2019;s performance on different subpopulations of the screening population, the model 2019;s design, training procedure, errors, and properties of its internal representations. Our best models are publicly available at https://github.com/nyukat/breast_cancer_classifier.

AB Automatic extraction of the road surface and road centerline from very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images has always been a challenging task in the field of feature extraction. Most existing road datasets are based on data with simple and clear backgrounds under ideal conditions, such as images derived from Google Earth. Therefore, the studies on road surface extraction and road centerline extraction under complex scenes are insufficient. Meanwhile, most existing efforts addressed these two tasks separately, without considering the possible joint extraction of road surface and centerline. With the introduction of multitask convolutional neural network models, it is possible to carry out these two tasks simultaneously by facilitating information sharing within a multitask deep learning model. In this study, we first design a challenging dataset using remote sensing images from the GF-2 satellite. The dataset contains complex road scenes with manually annotated images. We then propose a two-task and end-to-end convolution neural network, termed Multitask Road-related Extraction Network (MRENet), for road surface extraction and road centerline extraction. We take features extracted from the road as the condition of centerline extraction, and the information transmission and parameter sharing between the two tasks compensate for the potential problem of insufficient road centerline samples. In the network design, we use atrous convolutions and a pyramid scene parsing pooling module (PSP pooling), aiming to expand the network receptive field, integrate multilevel features, and obtain more abundant information. In addition, we use a weighted binary cross-entropy function to alleviate the background imbalance problem. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several comparative methods in the aspects of classification precision and visual interpretation.

ID WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; FRAMEWORK
AB Large-scale sensing devices spread over a wide area and compose the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to remotely control and monitor a specific process through collecting the sensing data from the working field. However, the trustworthy and energy efficient data collection is still a challenging issue for large-scale Internet of thing systems. In this article, a trust based energy efficient data collection with unmanned aerial vehicle (TEEDC-UAV) scheme is proposed to prolong lifetime with trustworthy style. First, in TEEDC-UAV scheme, an ant colony based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) trajectory optimization algorithm is proposed in which form the most data anchors in the working field with the trajectory as short as possible. Thus, the sensor nodes in SCADA system can be responsible for the least amount of data and greatly extend network life. Second, a trust reasoning and evolution mechanism is proposed to identify the trust degree of sensor nodes, and only trusted data will be collected so that the quality of data collection can be proved. In our proposed trust mechanism, the UAV can sense and collect data itself, so that data can be used as the baseline to identify the trust degree of sensor nodes. Finally, proved by sufficient experiment results, our proposed TEEDC-UAV scheme can find an optimized data collection trajectory efficiently, which helps the energy consumption of the network become much more balanced. Compared with previous strategies, the network life is greatly improved by 48.9%. Meanwhile, the trust mechanism proposed in this article can also greatly improve the identification accuracy of node trust degree, which reached 91% when consuming only 8% network life.

AB Background: Lately, terrestrial point clouds have drawn attention as a new data source for in situ forest investigations. So far, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has the highest data quality among all terrestrial point cloud data in terms of geometric accuracy and level of detail (IEEE Transact Geosci Remote Sens 53: 5117-5132, 2015). The TLS point clouds processed by automated algorithms can provide certain individual tree parameters at close to required accuracy in practical applications. However, all terrestrial point clouds face a general challenge, which is the occlusions of upper tree crowns. An emerging technology called unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) - borne laser scanning (ULS) potentially combines the strengths of above and under canopy surveys.
   Results: The performance of ULS are evaluated in 22 sample plots of various forest stand conditions in a boreal forest. The forest parameter estimates are benchmarked through a comparison with state-of-the-art terrestrial mechanisms from both static terrestrial and mobile laser scanning. The results show that in easy forest stand conditions, the performance of ULS point cloud is comparable with the terrestrial solutions.
   Conclusions: This study gives the first strict evaluation of ULS in situ observations in varied forest conditions. The study also acts as a benchmarking of available active remote sensing techniques for forest in situ mensuration. The results indicate that the current off-the-shelf ULS has an excellent tree height/tops measurement performance. Although the geometrical accuracy of the ULS data, especially at the stem parts, does not yet reach the level of other terrestrial point clouds, the unbeatable high mobility and fast data acquisition make the ULS a very attractive option in forest investigations.

AB Semantic segmentation is a fundamental research in optical remote sensing image processing. Because of the complex maritime environment, the sea-land segmentation is a challenging task. Although the neural network has achieved excellent performance in semantic segmentation in the last years, there were a few of works using CNN for sea-land segmentation and the results could be further improved. This paper proposes a novel deep convolution neural network named DeepUNet. Like the U-Net, its structure has a contracting path and an expansive path to get high-resolution optical output. But differently, the DeepUNet uses DownBlocks instead of convolution layers in the contracting path and uses UpBlock in the expansive path. The two novel blocks bring two new connections that are U-connection and Plus connection. They are promoted to get more precise segmentation results. To verify the network architecture, we construct a new challenging sea-land dataset and compare the DeepUNet on it with the U-Net, SegNet, and SeNet. Experimental results show that DeepUNet can improve 1-2% accuracy performance compared with other architectures, especially in high-resolution optical remote sensing imagery.

AB Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) and reinforcement learning are quite relevant to each other when performing intelligent optimization. They are both regarded as promising methods involving important components of evaluation and improvement, at the background of information technology, such as artificial intelligence, big data, and deep learning. Although great progresses have been achieved and surveyed when addressing nonlinear optimal control problems, the research on robustness of ADP-based control strategies under uncertain environment has not been fully summarized. Hence, this survey reviews the recent main results of adaptive-critic-based robust control design of continuous-time nonlinear systems. The ADP-based nonlinear optimal regulation is reviewed, followed by robust stabilization of nonlinear systems with matched uncertainties, guaranteed cost control design of unmatched plants, and decentralized stabilization of interconnected systems. Additionally, further comprehensive discussions are presented, including event-based robust control design, improvement of the critic learning rule, nonlinear H-infinity control design, and several notes on future perspectives. By applying the ADP-based optimal and robust control methods to a practical power system and an overhead crane plant, two typical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical results. Overall, this survey is beneficial to promote the development of adaptive critic control methods with robustness guarantee and the construction of higher level intelligent systems.

AB A critical challenge in neuromorphic computing is to present computationally efficient algorithms of learning. When implementing gradient-based learning, error information must be routed through the network, such that each neuron knows its contribution to output, and thus how to adjust its weight. This is known as the credit assignment problem. Exactly implementing a solution like backpropagation involves weight sharing, which requires additional bandwidth and computations in a neuromorphic system. Instead, models of learning from neuroscience can provide inspiration for how to communicate error information efficiently, without weight sharing. Here we present a novel dendritic event-based processing (DEP) algorithm, using a two-compartment leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with partially segregated dendrites that effectively solves the credit assignment problem. In order to optimize the proposed algorithm, a dynamic fixed-point representation method and piecewise linear approximation approach are presented, while the synaptic events are binarized during learning. The presented optimization makes the proposed DEP algorithm very suitable for implementation in digital or mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware. The experimental results show that spiking representations can rapidly learn, achieving high performance by using the proposed DEP algorithm. We find the learning capability is affected by the degree of dendritic segregation, and the form of synaptic feedback connections. This study provides a bridge between the biological learning and neuromorphic learning, and is meaningful for the real-time applications in the field of artificial intelligence.

AB Background:
   Individuals with acute-onset central nervous system (CNS) injury, including stroke, motor incomplete spinal cord injury, or traumatic brain injury, often experience lasting locomotor deficits, as quantified by decreases in gait speed and distance walked over a specific duration (timed distance). The goal of the present clinical practice guideline was to delineate the relative efficacy of various interventions to improve walking speed and timed distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following these specific diagnoses.
   Methods:
   A systematic review of the literature published between 1995 and 2016 was performed in 4 databases for randomized controlled clinical trials focused on these specific patient populations, at least 6 months postinjury and with specific outcomes of walking speed and timed distance. For all studies, specific parameters of training interventions including frequency, intensity, time, and type were detailed as possible. Recommendations were determined on the basis of the strength of the evidence and the potential harm, risks, or costs of providing a specific training paradigm, particularly when another intervention may be available and can provide greater benefit.
   Results:
   Strong evidence indicates that clinicians should offer walking training at moderate to high intensities or virtual reality-based training to ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance. In contrast, weak evidence suggests that strength training, circuit (ie, combined) training or cycling training at moderate to high intensities, and virtual reality-based balance training may improve walking speed and distance in these patient groups. Finally, strong evidence suggests that body weight-supported treadmill training, robotic-assisted training, or sitting/standing balance training without virtual reality should not be performed to improve walking speed or distance in ambulatory individuals greater than 6 months following acute-onset CNS injury to improve walking speed or distance.
   Discussion:
   The collective findings suggest that large amounts of task-specific (ie, locomotor) practice may be critical for improvements in walking function, although only at higher cardiovascular intensities or with augmented feedback to increase patient's engagement. Lower-intensity walking interventions or impairment-based training strategies demonstrated equivocal or limited efficacy.
   Limitations:
   As walking speed and distance were primary outcomes, the research participants included in the studies walked without substantial physical assistance. This guideline may not apply to patients with limited ambulatory function, where provision of walking training may require substantial physical assistance.
   The guideline suggests that task-specific walking training should be performed to improve walking speed and distance in those with acute-onset CNS injury although only at higher intensities or with augmented feedback. Future studies should clarify the potential utility of specific training parameters that lead to improved walking speed and distance in these populations in both chronic and subacute stages following injury.
   Disclaimer:
   These recommendations are intended as a guide for clinicians to optimize rehabilitation outcomes for persons with chronic stroke, incomplete spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury to improve walking speed and distance.

AB Automatic detection of multi-class objects in remote sensing images is a fundamental but challenging problem faced for remote sensing image analysis. Traditional methods are based on hand-crafted or shallow-learning-based features with limited representation power. Recently, deep learning algorithms, especially Faster region based convolutional neural networks (FRCN), has shown their much stronger detection power in computer vision field. However, several challenges limit the applications of FRCN in multi-class objects detection from remote sensing images: (1) Objects often appear at very different scales in remote sensing images, and FRCN with a fixed receptive field cannot match the scale variability of different objects; (2) Objects in large-scale remote sensing images are relatively small in size and densely peaked, and FRCN has poor localization performance with small objects; (3) Manual annotation is generally expensive and the available manual annotation of objects for training FRCN are not sufficient in number. To address these problems, this paper proposes a unified and effective method for simultaneously detecting multi-class objects in remote sensing images with large scales variability. Firstly, we redesign the feature extractor by adopting Concatenated ReLU and Inception module, which can increases the variety of receptive field size. Then, the detection is preformed by two sub-networks: a multi-scale object proposal network (MS-OPN) for object-like region generation from several intermediate layers, whose receptive fields match different object scales, and an accurate object detection network (AODN) for object detection based on fused feature maps, which combines several feature maps that enables small and densely packed objects to produce stronger response. For large-scale remote sensing images with limited manual annotations, we use cropped image blocks for training and augment them with re-scalings and rotations. The quantitative comparison results on the challenging NWPU VHR-10 data set, aircraft data set, Aerial-Vehicle data set and SAR-Ship data set show that our method is more accurate than existing algorithms and is effective for multi-modal remote sensing images.

AB Advances in brain science and computer technology in the past decade have led to exciting developments in brain-computer interface (BCI), thereby making BCI a top research area in applied science. The renaissance of BCI opens new methods of neurorehabilitation for physically disabled people (e.g. paralyzed patients and amputees) and patients with brain injuries (e.g. stroke patients). Recent technological advances such as wireless recording, machine learning analysis, and real-time temporal resolution have increased interest in electroencephalographic (EEG) based BCI approaches. Many BCI studies have focused on decoding EEG signals associated with whole-body kinematics/kinetics, motor imagery, and various senses. Thus, there is a need to understand the various experimental paradigms used in EEG-based BCI systems. Moreover, given that there are many available options, it is essential to choose the most appropriate BCI application to properly manipulate a neuroprosthetic or neurorehabilitation device. The current review evaluates EEG-based BCI paradigms regarding their advantages and disadvantages from a variety of perspectives. For each paradigm, various EEG decoding algorithms and classification methods are evaluated. The applications of these paradigms with targeted patients are summarized. Finally, potential problems with EEG-based BCI systems are discussed, and possible solutions are proposed.

AB Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, have attracted a lot of attention, since they represent a new potential market. Along with the maturity of the technology and relevant regulations, a worldwide deployment of these UAVs is expected. Thanks to the high mobility of drones, they can be used to provide a lot of applications, such as service delivery, pollution mitigation, farming, and in the rescue operations. Due to its ubiquitous usability, the UAV will play an important role in the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, and it may become the main key enabler of this vision. While these UAVs would be deployed for specific objectives (e.g., service delivery), they can be, at the same time, used to offer new IoT value-added services when they are equipped with suitable and remotely controllable machine type communications (MTCs) devices (i.e., sensors, cameras, and actuators). However, deploying UAVs for the envisioned purposes cannot be done before overcoming the relevant challenging issues. These challenges comprise not only technical issues, such as physical collision, but also regulation issues as this nascent technology could be associated with problems like breaking the privacy of people or even use it for illegal operations like drug smuggling. Providing the communication to UAVs is another challenging issue facing the deployment of this technology. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on the UAVs and the related issues will be introduced. In addition, our envisioned UAV-based architecture for the delivery of UAV-based value-added IoT services from the sky will be introduced, and the relevant key challenges and requirements will be presented.

AB Rapid quantification methods for sugar-free Yangwei granules were developed based on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with machine learning approaches as a quality control strategy for Chinese medicine granules (CMGs). Different machine learning approaches-i.e., interval partial least squares optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA-iPLS), the backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), and the particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM)-were used to develop prediction models for three active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), namely, albiflorin, paeoniflorin, and benzoylpaeoniflorin. The partial least squares (PLS) algorithm was used for linear model calibration and comparison of the prediction performance of these developed models. The performance of the final models was assessed by the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error of calibration set (RMSEC), and root mean square error of prediction set (RMSEP). All models performed well in model fitting and provided satisfactory prediction accuracy. The results indicate that the machine learning approaches are more stable, predictable, and suitable for CMGs when a high-accuracy analysis is required. In summary, NIR spectroscopy coupled with machine learning techniques is a suitable tool for the straightforward quantification of CMGs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Building energy use prediction plays an important role in building energy management and conservation as it can help us to evaluate building energy efficiency, conduct building commissioning, and detect and diagnose building system faults. Building energy prediction can be broadly classified into engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based, and hybrid approaches. While engineering and hybrid approaches use thermodynamic equations to estimate energy use, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future energy use under constraints. Owing to the ease of use and adaptability to seek optimal solutions in a rapid manner, the AI-based approach has gained popularity in recent years. For this reason and to discuss recent developments in the AI based approaches for building energy use prediction, this paper conducts an in-depth review of single AI-based methods such as multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector regression, and ensemble prediction method that, by combining multiple single AI-based prediction models improves the prediction accuracy manifold. This paper elaborates the principles, applications, advantages and limitations of these AI-based prediction methods and concludes with a discussion on the future directions of the research on AI-based methods for building energy use prediction.

AB Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) includes two novel GIS-based ensemble artificial intelligence approaches called imperialistic competitive algorithm (ICA) and firefly algorithm (FA). This combination could result in ANFIS-ICA and ANFIS-FA models, which were applied to flood spatial modelling and its mapping in the Haraz watershed in Northern Province of Mazandaran, Iran. Ten influential factors including slope angle, elevation, stream power index (SPI), curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), lithology, rainfall, land use, stream density, and the distance to river were selected for flood modelling. The validity of the models was assessed using statistical error-indices (RMSE and MSE), statistical tests (Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests), and the area under the curve (AUC) of success. The prediction accuracy of the models was compared to some new state-of-theart sophisticated machine learning techniques that had previously been successfully tested in the study area. The results confirmed the goodness of fit and appropriate prediction accuracy of the two ensemble models. However, the ANFIS-ICA model (AUC = 0.947) had a better performance in comparison to the Bagging-LMT (AUC = 0.940), BLR (AUC = 0.936), LMT (AUC = 0.934), ANFIS-FA (AUC = 0.917), LR (AUC = 0.885) and RF (AUC = 0.806) models. Therefore, the ANFIS-ICA model can be introduced as a promising method for the sustainable management of flood-prone areas.

AB Lung cancer is one of the dangerous diseases that cause huge cancer death worldwide. Early detection of lung cancer is the only possible way to improve a patient's chance for survival. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan used to find the position of tumor and identify the level of cancer in the body. The current study presents an innovative automated diagnosis classification method for Computed Tomography (CT) images of lungs. In this paper, the CT scan of lung images was analyzed with the assistance of Optimal Deep Neural Network (ODNN) and Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA). The deep features extracted from a CT lung images and then dimensionality of feature is reduced using LDR to classify lung nodules as either malignant or benign. The ODNN is applied to CT images and then, optimized using Modified Gravitational Search Algorithm (MGSA) for identify the lung cancer classification The comparative results show that the proposed classifier gives the sensitivity of 96.2%, specificity of 94.2% and accuracy of 94.56%.

AB Fibrillations and flutters are serious diseases influence the normal functioning of the heart. Among the most frequently occurring heart disorders belong atrial fibrillation (A(fib)), atrial flutter (A(fi)), and ventricular fibrillation (V-fib). Nowadays, heart failures are mostly detected by electrocardiogram (ECG) device by examining the signal transferred from electrodes placed on the human body to the output display. The signal is examined by professional health personnel, who are looking for an obvious pattern representing the normal or abnormal rhythm of the heart. Nevertheless, information from ECG can be distorted by noise on data transmission. Moreover,problematic pattern does not have to be so much different from normal and it can be difficult to recognize them just by human eye even by an expert in the field. An automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is an approach to make decision support for elimination of these lacks. For early diagnosis, CAD tool should work in like real-time system without big time consuming and dependency on data and measuring differences of each device. This paper proposes a novel approach of a CAD system to the detection of fibrillations and flutters by our 8-layer deep convolutional neural network. Proposed model requires only basic data normalization without pre-processing and feature extraction from raw ECG samples. We have achieved the accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of 98.45%, 99.27%, and 99.87% respectively. Designed system can be directly implemented like decision support system in clinical environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   FRAMEWORK
AB The advent of Deep Learning (DL) is poised to dramatically change the delivery of healthcare in the near future. Not only has DL profoundly affected the healthcare industry it has also influenced global businesses. Within a span of very few years, advances such as self-driving cars, robots performing jobs that are hazardous to human, and chat bots talking with human operators have proved that DL has already made large impact on our lives. The open source nature of DL and decreasing prices of computer hardware will further propel such changes. In healthcare, the potential is immense due to the need to automate the processes and evolve error free paradigms. The sheer quantum of DL publications in healthcare has surpassed other domains growing at a very fast pace, particular in radiology. It is therefore imperative for the radiologists to learn about DL and how it differs from other approaches of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The next generation of radiology will see a significant role of DL and will likely serve as the base for augmented radiology (AR). Better clinical judgement by AR will help in improving the quality of life and help in life saving decisions, while lowering healthcare costs.
   A comprehensive review of DL as well as its implications upon the healthcare is presented in this review. We had analysed 150 articles of DL in healthcare domain from PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE EXPLORE focused in medical imagery only. We have further examined the ethic, moral and legal issues surrounding the use of DL in medical imaging.

AB Hydropower is among the cleanest sources of energy. However, the rate of hydropower generation is profoundly affected by the inflow to the dam reservoirs. In this study, the Grey wolf optimization (GWO) method coupled with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to forecast the hydropower generation. For this purpose, the Dez basin average of rainfall was calculated using Thiessen polygons. Twenty input combinations, including the inflow to the dam, the rainfall and the hydropower in the previous months were used, while the output in all the scenarios was one month of hydropower generation. Then, the coupled model was used to forecast the hydropower generation. Results indicated that the method was promising. GWO-ANFIS was capable of predicting the hydropower generation satisfactorily, while the ANFIS failed in nine input-output combinations.

AB Traditional von Neumann computing systems involve separate processing and memory units. However, data movement is costly in terms of time and energy and this problem is aggravated by the recent explosive growth in highly data-centric applications related to artificial intelligence. This calls for a radical departure from the traditional systems and one such non-von Neumann computational approach is in-memory computing. Hereby certain computational tasks are performed in place in the memory itself by exploiting the physical attributes of the memory devices. Both charge-based and resistance-based memory devices are being explored for in-memory computing. In this Review, we provide a broad overview of the key computational primitives enabled by these memory devices as well as their applications spanning scientific computing, signal processing, optimization, machine learning, deep learning and stochastic computing.
   This Review provides an overview of memory devices and the key computational primitives for in-memory computing, and examines the possibilities of applying this computing approach to a wide range of applications.

AB We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.

ID OBJECT DETECTION; SEGMENTATION
AB Current top performing object detectors employ detection proposals to guide the search for objects, thereby avoiding exhaustive sliding window search across images. Despite the popularity and widespread use of detection proposals, it is unclear which trade-offs are made when using them during object detection. We provide an in-depth analysis of twelve proposal methods along with four baselines regarding proposal repeatability, ground truth annotation recall on PASCAL, ImageNet, and MS COCO, and their impact on DPM, R-CNN, and Fast R-CNN detection performance. Our analysis shows that for object detection improving proposal localisation accuracy is as important as improving recall. We introduce a novel metric, the average recall (AR), which rewards both high recall and good localisation and correlates surprisingly well with detection performance. Our findings show common strengths and weaknesses of existing methods, and provide insights and metrics for selecting and tuning proposal methods.

ID COLOR
AB We present a bottom-up aggregation approach to image segmentation. Beginning with an image, we execute a sequence of steps in which pixels are gradually merged to produce larger and larger regions. In each step, we consider pairs of adjacent regions and provide a probability measure to assess whether or not they should be included in the same segment. Our probabilistic formulation takes into account intensity and texture distributions in a local area around each region. It further incorporates priors based on the geometry of the regions. Finally, posteriors based on intensity and texture cues are combined using "a mixture of experts" formulation. This probabilistic approach is integrated into a graph coarsening scheme, providing a complete hierarchical segmentation of the image. The algorithm complexity is linear in the number of the image pixels and it requires almost no user-tuned parameters. In addition, we provide a novel evaluation scheme for image segmentation algorithms, attempting to avoid human semantic considerations that are out of scope for segmentation algorithms. Using this novel evaluation scheme, we test our method and provide a comparison to several existing segmentation algorithms.

ID OBJECT DETECTION; MODEL
AB Visual saliency is a fundamental problem in both cognitive and computational sciences, including computer vision. In this paper, we discover that a high-quality visual saliency model can be learned from multiscale features extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have had many successes in visual recognition tasks. For learning such saliency models, we introduce a neural network architecture, which has fully connected layers on top of CNNs responsible for feature extraction at three different scales. The penultimate layer of our neural network has been confirmed to be a discriminative high-level feature vector for saliency detection, which we call deep contrast feature. To generate a more robust feature, we integrate handcrafted low-level features with our deep contrast feature. To promote further research and evaluation of visual saliency models, we also construct a new large database of 4447 challenging images and their pixelwise saliency annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is capable of achieving the state-of-the-art performance on all public benchmarks, improving the F-measure by 6.12% and 10%, respectively, on the DUT-OMRON data set and our new data set (HKU-IS), and lowering the mean absolute error by 9% and 35.3%, respectively, on these two data sets.

AB Manufacturers have faced an increasing need for the development of predictive models that predict mechanical failures and the remaining useful life (RUL) of manufacturing systems or components. Classical model-based or physics-based prognostics often require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest to develop closed-form mathematical models. However, prior knowledge of system behavior is not always available, especially for complex manufacturing systems and processes. To complement model-based prognostics, data-driven methods have been increasingly applied to machinery prognostics and maintenance management, transforming legacy manufacturing systems into smart manufacturing systems with artificial intelligence. While previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of data-driven methods, most of these prognostic methods are based on classical machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR). With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, various machine learning algorithms have been developed and widely applied in many engineering fields. The objective of this research is to introduce a random forests (RFs)-based prognostic method for tool wear prediction as well as compare the performance of RFs with feed-forward back propagation (FFBP) ANNs and SVR. Specifically, the performance of FFBP ANNs, SVR, and RFs are compared using an experimental data collected from 315 milling tests. Experimental results have shown that RFs can generate more accurate predictions than FFBP ANNs with a single hidden layer and SVR.

AB Deep learning (DL) is a family of machine learning methods that has gained considerable attention in the scientific community, breaking benchmark records in areas such as speech and visual recognition. DL differs from conventional machine learning methods by virtue of its ability to learn the optimal representation from the raw data through consecutive nonlinear transformations, achieving increasingly higher levels of abstraction and complexity. Given its ability to detect abstract and complex patterns, DL has been applied in neuroimaging studies of psychiatric and neurological disorders, which are characterised by subtle and diffuse alterations. Here we introduce the underlying concepts of DL and review studies that have used this approach to classify brain-based disorders. The results of these studies indicate that DL could be a powerful tool in the current search for biomarkers of psychiatric and neurologic disease. We conclude our review by discussing the main promises and challenges of using DL to elucidate brain-based disorders, as well as possible directions for future research. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB Machine learning (ML) algorithms have made a tremendous impact in the field of medical imaging. While medical imaging datasets have been growing in size, a challenge for supervised ML algorithms that is frequently mentioned is the lack of annotated data. As a result, various methods that can learn with less/other types of supervision, have been proposed. We give an overview of semi-supervised, multiple instance, and transfer learning in medical imaging, both in diagnosis or segmentation tasks. We also discuss connections between these learning scenarios, and opportunities for future research.

AB More recently, remote sensing image classification has been moving from pixel-level interpretation to scene-level semantic understanding, which aims to label each scene image with a specific semantic class. While significant efforts have been made in developing various methods for remote sensing image scene classification, most of them rely on handcrafted features. In this letter, we propose a novel feature representation method for scene classification, named bag of convolutional features (BoCF). Different from the traditional bag of visual words-based methods in which the visual words are usually obtained by using handcrafted feature descriptors, the proposed BoCF generates visual words from deep convolutional features using off-the-shelf convolutional neural networks. Extensive evaluations on a publicly available remote sensing image scene classification benchmark and comparison with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed BoCF method for remote sensing image scene classification.

AB Many computer vision tasks can be formulated as labeling problems. The desired solution is often a spatially smooth labeling where label transitions are aligned with color edges of the input image. We show that such solutions can be efficiently achieved by smoothing the label costs with a very fast edge-preserving filter. In this paper, we propose a generic and simple framework comprising three steps: 1) constructing a cost volume, 2) fast cost volume filtering, and 3) Winner-Takes-All label selection. Our main contribution is to show that with such a simple framework state-of-the-art results can be achieved for several computer vision applications. In particular, we achieve 1) disparity maps in real time whose quality exceeds those of all other fast (local) approaches on the Middlebury stereo benchmark, and 2) optical flow fields which contain very fine structures as well as large displacements. To demonstrate robustness, the few parameters of our framework are set to nearly identical values for both applications. Also, competitive results for interactive image segmentation are presented. With this work, we hope to inspire other researchers to leverage this framework to other application areas.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed key aspects of human life. Machine learning (ML), which is a subset of AI wherein machines autonomously acquire information by extracting patterns from large databases, has been increasingly used within the medical community, and specifically within the domain of cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we present a brief overview of ML methodologies that are used for the construction of inferential and predictive data-driven models. We highlight several domains of ML application such as echocardiography, electrocardiography, and recently developed non-invasive imaging modalities such as coronary artery calcium scoring and coronary computed tomography angiography. We conclude by reviewing the limitations associated with contemporary application of ML algorithms within the cardiovascular disease field.

AB Floods are one of the most damaging natural hazards causing huge loss of property, infrastructure and lives. Prediction of occurrence of flash flood locations is very difficult due to sudden change in climatic condition and manmade factors. However, prior identification of flood susceptible areas can be done with the help of machine learning techniques for proper timely management of flood hazards. In this study, we tested four decision trees based machine learning models namely Logistic Model Trees (LMT), Reduced Error Pruning Trees (REPT), Naive Bayes Trees (NBT), and Alternating Decision Trees (ADT) for flash flood susceptibility mapping at the Haraz Watershed in the northern part of Iran. For this, a spatial database was constructed with 201 present and past flood locations and eleven flood-influencing factors namely ground slope, altitude, curvature, Stream Power Index (SPI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), land use, rainfall, river density, distance from river, lithology, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Statistical evaluation measures, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, and Freidman and Wilcoxon signed-rank testswere used to validate and compare the prediction capability of the models. Results showthat the ADT model has the highest prediction capability for flash flood susceptibility assessment, followed by the NBT, the LMT, and the REPT, respectively. These techniques have proven successful in quickly determining flood susceptible areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The impressive capabilities of the mammalian brain-ranging from perception, pattern recognition and memory formation to decision making and motor activity control-have inspired their re-creation in a wide range of artificial intelligence systems for applications such as face recognition, anomaly detection, medical diagnosis and robotic vehicle control(1). Yet before neuron-based brains evolved, complex biomolecular circuits provided individual cells with the 'intelligent' behaviour required for survival(2). However, the study of how molecules can 'think' has not produced an equal variety of computational models and applications of artificial chemical systems. Although biomolecular systems have been hypothesized to carry out neural-network-like computations in vivo(3,2,4) and the synthesis of artificial chemical analogues has been proposed theoretically(5-9), experimental work(10-13) has so far fallen short of fully implementing even a single neuron. Here, building on the richness of DNA computing(14) and strand displacement circuitry(15), we show how molecular systems can exhibit autonomous brain-like behaviours. Using a simple DNA gate architecture(16) that allows experimental scale-up of multilayer digital circuits(17), we systematically transform arbitrary linear threshold circuits(18) (an artificial neural network model) into DNA strand displacement cascades that function as small neural networks. Our approach even allows us to implement a Hopfield associative memory(19) with four fully connected artificial neurons that, after training in silico, remembers four single-stranded DNA patterns and recalls the most similar one when presented with an incomplete pattern. Our results suggest that DNA strand displacement cascades could be used to endow autonomous chemical systems with the capability of recognizing patterns of molecular events, making decisions and responding to the environment.

AB Background and objective: During the recent global urgency, scientists, clinicians, and healthcare experts around the globe keep on searching for a new technology to support in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. The evidence of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) application on the previous epidemic encourage researchers by giving a new angle to fight against the novel Coronavirus outbreak. This paper aims to comprehensively review the role of AI and ML as one significant method in the arena of screening, predicting, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug development for SARS-CoV-2 and its related epidemic.
   Method: A selective assessment of information on the research article was executed on the databases related to the application of ML and AI technology on Covid-19. Rapid and critical analysis of the three crucial parameters, i.e., abstract, methodology, and the conclusion was done to relate to the model's possibilities for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
   Result: This paper addresses on recent studies that apply ML and AI technology towards augmenting the researchers on multiple angles. It also addresses a few errors and challenges while using such algorithms in real-world problems. The paper also discusses suggestions conveying researchers on model design, medical experts, and policymakers in the current situation while tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and ahead.
   Conclusion: The ongoing development in AI and ML has significantly improved treatment, medication, screening, prediction, forecasting, contact tracing, and drug/vaccine development process for the Covid-19 pandemic and reduce the human intervention in medical practice. However, most of the models are not deployed enough to show their real-world operation, but they are still up to the mark to tackle the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

ID OPTIMAL TRANSPORT-THEORY
AB In this paper, a novel concept of three-dimensional (3D) cellular networks, that integrate drone base stations (drone-BS) and cellular-connected drone users (drone-UEs), is introduced. For this new 3D cellular architecture, a novel framework for network planning for drone-BSs and latency-minimal cell association for drone-UEs is proposed. For network planning, a tractable method for drone-BSs' deployment based on the notion of truncated octahedron shapes is proposed, which ensures full coverage for a given space with a minimum number of drone-BSs. In addition, to characterize frequency planning in such 3D wireless networks, an analytical expression for the feasible integer frequency reuse factors is derived. Subsequently, an optimal 3D cell association scheme is developed for which the drone-UEs' latency, considering transmission, computation, and backhaul delays, is minimized. To this end, first, the spatial distribution of the drone-UEs is estimated using a kernel density estimation method, and the parameters of the estimator are obtained using a cross-validation method. Then, according to the spatial distribution of drone-UEs and the locations of drone-BSs, the latency-minimal 3D cell association for drone-UEs is derived by exploiting tools from an optimal transport theory. The simulation results show that the proposed approach reduces the latency of drone-UEs compared with the classical cell association approach that uses a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) criterion. In particular, the proposed approach yields a reduction of up to 46% in the average latency compared with the SINR-based association. The results also show that the proposed latency-optimal cell association improves the spectral efficiency of a 3D wireless cellular network of drones.

AB Incorporation of prior knowledge about organ shape and location is key to improve performance of image analysis approaches. In particular, priors can be useful in cases where images are corrupted and contain artefacts due to limitations in image acquisition. The highly constrained nature of anatomical objects can be well captured with learning-based techniques. However, in most recent and promising techniques such as CNN-based segmentation it is not obvious how to incorporate such prior knowledge. State-of-the-art methods operate as pixel-wise classifiers where the training objectives do not incorporate the structure and inter-dependencies of the output. To overcome this limitation, we propose a generic training strategy that incorporates anatomical prior knowledge into CNNs through a new regularisation model, which is trained end-to-end. The new framework encourages models to follow the global anatomical properties of the underlying anatomy (e.g. shape, label structure) via learnt non-linear representations of the shape. We show that the proposed approach can be easily adapted to different analysis tasks (e.g. image enhancement, segmentation) and improve the prediction accuracy of the state-of-the-art models. The applicability of our approachis shown on-multi-modal cardiac data sets and public benchmarks. In addition, we demonstrate how the learnt deep models of 3-D shapes can be interpreted and used as biomarkers for classification of cardiac pathologies.

ID SELECTION; CLASSIFICATION
AB Advances in neuroimaging, genomic, motion tracking, eye-tracking and many other technology-based data collection methods have led to a torrent of high dimensional datasets, which commonly have a small number of samples because of the intrinsic high cost of data collection involving human participants. High dimensional data with a small number of samples is of critical importance for identifying biomarkers and conducting feasibility and pilot work, however it can lead to biased machine learning (ML) performance estimates. Our review of studies which have applied ML to predict autistic from non-autistic individuals showed that small sample size is associated with higher reported classification accuracy. Thus, we have investigated whether this bias could be caused by the use of validation methods which do not sufficiently control overfitting. Our simulations show that K-fold Cross-Validation (CV) produces strongly biased performance estimates with small sample sizes, and the bias is still evident with sample size of 1000. Nested CV and train/test split approaches produce robust and unbiased performance estimates regardless of sample size. We also show that feature selection if performed on pooled training and testing data is contributing to bias considerably more than parameter tuning. In addition, the contribution to bias by data dimensionality, hyper-parameter space and number of CV folds was explored, and validation methods were compared with discriminable data. The results suggest how to design robust testing methodologies when working with small datasets and how to interpret the results of other studies based on what validation method was used.

ID PREDICTION
AB Unprecedented high volumes of data are becoming available with the growth of the advanced metering infrastructure. These arc expected to benefit planning and operation of the future power systems and to help customers transition from a passive to an active role. In this paper, we explore for the first time in the smart grid context the benefits of using deep reinforcement learning, a hybrid type of methods that combines reinforcement learning with deep learning, to perform on-line optimization of schedules for building energy management systems. The learning procedure was explored using two methods, Deep Q-learning and deep policy gradient, both of which have been extended to perform multiple actions simultaneously. The proposed approach was validated on the large-scale Pecan Street Inc. database. This highly dimensional database includes information about photovoltaic power generation, electric vehicles and buildings appliances. Moreover, these on-line energy scheduling strategies could be used to provide real-time feedback to consumers to encourage more efficient use of electricity.

AB Deep learning (DL) has proved successful in medical imaging and, in the wake of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, some works have started to investigate DL-based solutions for the assisted diagnosis of lung diseases. While existing works focus on CT scans, this paper studies the application of DL techniques for the analysis of lung ultrasonography (LUS) images. Specifically, we present a novel fully-annotated dataset of LUS images collected from several Italian hospitals, with labels indicating the degree of disease severity at a frame-level, video-level, and pixel-level (segmentation masks). Leveraging these data, we introduce several deep models that address relevant tasks for the automatic analysis of LUS images. In particular, we present a novel deep network, derived from Spatial Transformer Networks, which simultaneously predicts the disease severity score associated to a input frame and provides localization of pathological artefacts in a weakly-supervised way. Furthermore, we introduce a new method based on uninorms for effective frame score aggregation at a video-level. Finally, we benchmark state of the art deep models for estimating pixel-level segmentations of COVID-19 imaging biomarkers. Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate satisfactory results on all the considered tasks, paving the way to future research on DL for the assisted diagnosis of COVID-19 from LUS data.

AB Weather and climate models approximate diabatic and sub-grid-scale processes in terms of grid-scale variables using parameterizations. Current parameterizations are designed by humans based on physical understanding, observations, and process modeling. As a result, they are numerically efficient and interpretable, but potentially oversimplified. However, the advent of global high-resolution simulations and observations enables a more robust approach based on machine learning. In this letter, a neural network-based parameterization is trained using a near-global aqua-planet simulation with a 4-km resolution (NG-Aqua). The neural network predicts the apparent sources of heat and moisture averaged onto (160km)(2) grid boxes. A numerically stable scheme is obtained by minimizing the prediction error over multiple time steps rather than single one. In prognostic single-column model tests, this scheme matches both the fluctuations and equilibrium of NG-Aqua simulation better than the Community Atmosphere Model does.
   Plain Language Summary Computer-based atmospheric models predict future conditions based on physical laws. Unfortunately, current computers are not powerful enough to simulate these physical laws exactly and must represent the atmosphere as a 3-D digital image, with a pixel size, also known as resolution, of 100-200km. Scientists typically approximate any processes that occur below this size, such as rain clouds, using idealized physical models. Unfortunately, the ability of these models to represent the atmosphere's true complexity is limited by a scientist's imagination. The recent availability of large data sets, computational resources, and developments in computer science allows a different approach based on machine learning. In this article, we train one popular kind of machine learning model, known as neural network, to approximate the small-scale processes in climate model based on a high-resolution atmospheric simulation. To produce an accurate prediction, we had to reduce the prediction error of many days, rather than just a few hours. The resulting neural network matches the high-resolution simulation better than a state of the art traditional climate model does, a heartening result which suggests that machine learning can be blended with traditional approaches to produce better predictions of future weather and climate.

TI Phase-only transmissive spatial light modulator based on tunable

DT Article
ID SCATTERING; RESOLUTION
AB Rapidly developing augmented reality, solid-state light detection and ranging (LIDAR), and holographic display technologies require spatial light modulators (SLMs) with high resolution and viewing angle to satisfy increasing customer demands. Performance of currently available SLMs is limited by their large pixel sizes on the order of several micrometers. Here, we propose a concept of tunable dielectric metasurfaces modulated by liquid crystal, which can provide abrupt phase change, thus enabling pixel-size miniaturization. We present a metasurface-based transmissive SLM, configured to generate active beam steering with >35% efficiency and a large beam deflection angle of 11 degrees. The high resolution and steering angle obtained provide opportunities to develop the next generation of LIDAR and display technologies.

AB Recently, emotion classification from EEG data has attracted much attention with the rapid development of dry electrode techniques, machine learning algorithms, and various real-world applications of brain-computer interface for normal people. Until now, however, researchers had little understanding of the details of relationship between different emotional states and various EEG features. To improve the accuracy of EEG-based emotion classification and visualize the changes of emotional states with time, this paper systematically compares three kinds of existing EEG features for emotion classification, introduces an efficient feature smoothing method for removing the noise unrelated to emotion task, and proposes a simple approach to tracking the trajectory of emotion changes with manifold learning. To examine the effectiveness of these methods introduced in this paper, we design a movie induction experiment that spontaneously leads subjects to real emotional states and collect an EEG data set of six subjects. From experimental results on our EEG data set, we found that (a) power spectrum feature is superior to other two kinds of features; (b) a linear dynamic system based feature smoothing method can significantly improve emotion classification accuracy; and (c) the trajectory of emotion changes can be visualized by reducing subject-independent features with manifold learning.

AB The field of medical image reconstruction has seen roughly four types of methods. The first type tended to be analytical methods, such as filtered backprojection (FBP) for X-ray computed tomography (CT) and the inverse Fourier transform for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), based on simple mathematical models for the imaging systems. These methods are typically fast, but have suboptimal properties such as poor resolution-noise tradeoff for CT. A second type is iterative reconstruction methods based on more complete models for the imaging system physics and, where appropriate, models for the sensor statistics. These iterative methods improved image quality by reducing noise and artifacts. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved methods among these have been based on relatively simple regularization models. A third type of methods has been designed to accommodate modified data acquisition methods, such as reduced sampling in MRI and CT to reduce scan time or radiation dose. These methods typically involve mathematical image models involving assumptions such as sparsity or low rank. A fourth type of methods replaces mathematically designed models of signals and systems with data-driven or adaptive models inspired by the field of machine learning. This article focuses on the two most recent trends in medical image reconstruction: methods based on sparsity or low-rank models and data-driven methods based on machine learning techniques.

TI Asymmetric 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for action recognition
SO PATTERN RECOGNITION
LA English
DT Article
DE Asymmetric 3D convolution; MicroNets; 3D-CNN; Action recognition
ID FEATURES; FLOW
AB Convolutional Neural Network based action recognition methods have achieved significant improvements in recent years. The 3D convolution extends the 2D convolution to the spatial-temporal domain for better analysis of human activities in videos. The 3D convolution, however, involves many more parameters than the 2D convolution. Thus, it is much more expensive on computation, costly on storage, and difficult to learn. This work proposes efficient asymmetric one-directional 3D convolutions to approximate the traditional 3D convolution. To improve the feature learning capacity of asymmetric 3D convolutions, a set of local 3D convolutional networks, called MicroNets, are proposed by incorporating multi-scale 3D convolution branches. Then, an asymmetric 3D-CNN deep model is constructed by MicroNets for the action recognition task. Moreover, to avoid training two networks on the RGB and Flow frames separately as most works do, a simple but effective multi-source enhanced input is proposed, which fuses useful information of the RGB and Flow frame at the pre-processing stage.
   The asymmetric 3D-CNN model is evaluated on two of the most challenging action recognition benchmarks, UCF-101 and HMDB-51. The asymmetric 3D-CNN model outperforms all the traditional 3D-CNN models in both effectiveness and efficiency, and its performance is comparable with that of recent state-of-the-art action recognition methods on both benchmarks.

AB Deep learning models are widely used in the automatic analysis of radiological images. These techniques can train the weights of networks on large datasets as well as fine tuning the weights of pre-trained networks on small datasets. Due to the small COVID-19 dataset available, the pre-trained neural networks can be used for diagnosis of coronavirus. However, these techniques applied on chest CT image is very limited till now. Hence, the main aim of this paper to use the pre-trained deep learning architectures as an automated tool to detection and diagnosis of COVID-19 in chest CT. A DenseNet201 based deep transfer learning (DTL) is proposed to classify the patients as COVID infected or not i.e. COVID-19 (+) or COVID (-). The proposed model is utilized to extract features by using its own learned weights on the ImageNet dataset along with a convolutional neural structure. Extensive experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the propose DTL model on COVID-19 chest CT scan images. Comparative analyses reveal that the proposed DTL based COVID-19 classification model outperforms the competitive approaches. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB Distributed linguistic representations are powerful tools for modelling the uncertainty and complexity of preference information in linguistic decision making. To provide a comprehensive perspective on the development of distributed linguistic representations in decision making, we present the taxonomy of existing distributed linguistic representations. Then, we review the key elements and applications of distributed linguistic information processing in decision making, including the distance measurement, aggregation methods, distributed linguistic preference relations, and distributed linguistic multiple attribute decision making models. Next, we provide a discussion on ongoing challenges and future research directions from the perspective of data science and explainable artificial intelligence.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB In this letter, a novel deep learning framework for hyperspectral image classification using both spectral and spatial features is presented. The framework is a hybrid of principal component analysis, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and logistic regression (LR). The DCNNs for hierarchically extract deep features is introduced into hyperspectral image classification for the first time. The proposed technique consists of two steps. First, feature map generation algorithm is presented to generate the spectral and spatial feature maps. Second, the DCNNs-LR classifier is trained to get useful high-level features and to fine-tune the whole model. Comparative experiments conducted over widely used hyperspectral data indicate that DCNNs-LR classifier built in this proposed deep learning framework provides better classification accuracy than previous hyperspectral classification methods.

AB Objective: The aim of this review was to explore the current evidence for conversational agents or chatbots in the field of psychiatry and their role in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of mental illnesses. Methods: A systematic literature search in June 2018 was conducted in PubMed, EmBase, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. Studies were included that involved a chatbot in a mental health setting focusing on populations with or at high risk of developing depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar, and substance abuse disorders. Results: From the selected databases, 1466 records were retrieved and 8 studies met the inclusion criteria. Two additional studies were included from reference list screening for a total of 10 included studies. Overall, potential for conversational agents in psychiatric use was reported to be high across all studies. In particular, conversational agents showed potential for benefit in psychoeducation and self-adherence. In addition, satisfaction rating of chatbots was high across all studies, suggesting that they would be an effective and enjoyable tool in psychiatric treatment. Conclusion: Preliminary evidence for psychiatric use of chatbots is favourable. However, given the heterogeneity of the reviewed studies, further research with standardized outcomes reporting is required to more thoroughly examine the effectiveness of conversational agents. Regardless, early evidence shows that with the proper approach and research, the mental health field could use conversational agents in psychiatric treatment.

AB Computational imaging through scatter generally is accomplished by first characterizing the scattering medium so that its forward operator is obtained and then imposing additional priors in the form of regularizers on the reconstruction functional to improve the condition of the originally ill-posed inverse problem. In the functional, the forward operator and regularizer must be entered explicitly or parametrically (e.g., scattering matrices and dictionaries, respectively). However, the process of determining these representations is often incomplete, prone to errors, or infeasible. Recently, deep learning architectures have been proposed to instead learn both the forward operator and regularizer through examples. Here, we propose for the first time, to our knowledge, a convolutional neural network architecture called "IDiffNet" for the problem of imaging through diffuse media and demonstrate that IDiffNet has superior generalization capability through extensive tests with well-calibrated diffusers. We also introduce the negative Pearson correlation coefficient (NPCC) loss function for neural net training and show that the NPCC is more appropriate for spatially sparse objects and strong scattering conditions. Our results show that the convolutional architecture is robust to the choice of prior, as demonstrated by the use of multiple training and testing object databases, and capable of achieving higher space-bandwidth product reconstructions than previously reported.

TI Deep Patient: An Unsupervised Representation to Predict the Future of

ID RISK PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; STRATEGIES; DISORDERS; DIAGNOSIS
AB Secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs) promises to advance clinical research and better inform clinical decision making. Challenges in summarizing and representing patient data prevent widespread practice of predictive modeling using EHRs. Here we present a novel unsupervised deep feature learning method to derive a general-purpose patient representation from EHR data that facilitates clinical predictive modeling. In particular, a three-layer stack of denoising autoencoders was used to capture hierarchical regularities and dependencies in the aggregated EHRs of about 700,000 patients from the Mount Sinai data warehouse. The result is a representation we name "deep patient". We evaluated this representation as broadly predictive of health states by assessing the probability of patients to develop various diseases. We performed evaluation using 76,214 test patients comprising 78 diseases from diverse clinical domains and temporal windows. Our results significantly outperformed those achieved using representations based on raw EHR data and alternative feature learning strategies. Prediction performance for severe diabetes, schizophrenia, and various cancers were among the top performing. These findings indicate that deep learning applied to EHRs can derive patient representations that offer improved clinical predictions, and could provide a machine learning framework for augmenting clinical decision systems.

AB Q-learning-based operation strategies are being recently applied for optimal operation of energy storage systems, where, a Q-table is used to store Q-values for all possible state-action pairs. However, Q-learning faces challenges when it comes to large state space problems, i.e., continuous state space problems or problems with environment uncertainties. In order to address the limitations of Q-learning, this paper proposes a distributed operation strategy using double deep Q-learning method. It is applied to managing the operation of a community battery energy storage system (CBESS) in a microgrid system. In contrast to Q-learning, the proposed operation strategy is capable of dealing with uncertainties in the system in both grid-connected and islanded modes. This is due to the utilization of a deep neural network as a function approximator to estimate the Q-values. Moreover, the proposed method can mitigate the overestimation that is the major drawback of the standard deep Q-learning. The proposed method trains the model faster by decoupling the selection and evaluation processes. Finally, the performance of the proposed double deep Q-learning-based operation method is evaluated by comparing its results with a centralized approach-based operation.

DE Action recognition; Skeleton sequence; Rotation-based feature;
   Spatial-temporal feature; Geometric algebra
AB Recently, skeleton-based action recognition approaches achieve great improvement by providing various features from skeleton sequences as the inputs of deep neural networks for classification. Compared with other works which directly utilize the locations of joints as the representation of each action for recognition, our paper describes the relative relations embedded in skeletons to alleviate the impact of viewpoint diversity. Specifically, we propose a novel feature descriptor based on the rotation relations in skeletons to represent a certain action. Geometric algebra (GA) is introduced to calculate and derive the rotation relations according to the particular operator, namely the rotor in GA. In order to exploit the spatial and temporal characteristics in one skeleton sequence, we design two different rotor-based feature descriptors, respectively, from one frame of skeleton and two skeletons of consecutive frames. Then an efficient feature encoding strategy is proposed to transform each kind of feature descriptor into a RGB image. Afterward, we propose a two-stream convolutional neural network(CNN) based framework to learn the RGB images generated by each skeleton sequence and then fuse the scores of two networks to provide final recognition accuracy. Extensive experimental results on NTU RGB+D, Northwestern-UCLA, Gaming 3D, SYSU and UTD-MHAD datasets have demonstrated the superiority of our method.

AB This study proposed and compared several novel hybrid models that combined swarm intelligence algorithms and Deep Learning Neural Network for flood susceptibility mapping. Lai Chau, a province in the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam was chosen as a case study since it had recently undergone severe flashflood in 2018. For this purpose, numerical predictor variables such as topographically derived factors (Digital Elevation Model, Aspect, Slope, Curvature, Topographic Wetness Index), climatic variables (Rain), and hydrological variables (stream density, stream power index, distance to river) and multiple remote sensing indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Buildup Index) were used. These predictor variables were selected because they are globally collectible and reproducible. The performances of these models were evaluated by using common statistical indicators, namely Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error, Overall Accuracy and Area under Receiving Operating Characteristics, and the statistical test of differences. The results showed that the proposed swarm intelligence models outperformed benchmarked methods, namely Particle Swarm Optimization, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest in almost all comparing indicators. It is suggested that proposed models are more robust than the classifiers, which were used for benchmarking and they are good alternatives for flood susceptibility mapping given the availability of dataset.

AB Knowledge graph (KG) embedding is to embed components of a KG including entities and relations into continuous vector spaces, so as to simplify the manipulation while preserving the inherent structure of the KG. It can benefit a variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion and relation extraction, and hence has quickly gained massive attention. In this article, we provide a systematic review of existing techniques, including not only the state-of-the-arts but also those with latest trends. Particularly, we make the review based on the type of information used in the embedding task. Techniques that conduct embedding using only facts observed in the KG are first introduced. We describe the overall framework, specific model design, typical training procedures, as well as pros and cons of such techniques. After that, we discuss techniques that further incorporate additional information besides facts. We focus specifically on the use of entity types, relation paths, textual descriptions, and logical rules. Finally, we briefly introduce how KG embedding can be applied to and benefit a wide variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion, relation extraction, question answering, and so forth.

AB Two main issues for event-related potential (ERP) classification in brain-computer interface (BCI) application are curse-of-dimensionality and bias-variance tradeoff, which may deteriorate classification performance, especially with insufficient training samples resulted from limited calibration time. This study introduces an aggregation of sparse linear discriminant analyses (ASLDA) to overcome these problems. In the ASLDA, multiple sparse discriminant vectors are learned from differently l(1)-regularized least-squares regressions by exploiting the equivalence between LDA and least-squares regression, and are subsequently aggregated to form an ensemble classifier, which could not only implement automatic feature selection for dimensionality reduction to alleviate curse-of-dimensionality, but also decrease the variance to improve generalization capacity for new test samples. Extensive investigation and comparison are carried out among the ASLDA, the ordinary LDA and other competing ERP classification algorithms, based on different three ERP datasets. Experimental results indicate that the ASLDA yields better overall performance for single-trial ERP classification when insufficient training samples are available. This suggests the proposed ASLDA is promising for ERP classification in small sample size scenario to improve the practicability of BCI.

AB This study gives the mathematic model of a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and then proposes a robust nonlinear controller which combines the sliding-mode control technique and the backstepping control technique. To achieve Cartesian position trajectory tracking capability, the construction of the controller can be divided into two stages: a regular SMC controller for attitude subsystem (inner loop) is first developed to guarantee fast convergence rapidity of Euler angles and the backstepping technique is applied to the position loop until desired attitudes are obtained and then the ultimate control laws. The stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed by stabilizing each of the subsystems step by step and the robustness of the controller against model uncertainty and external disturbances is investigated. In addition, an adaptive observer-based fault estimation scheme is also considered for taking off mode. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed robust nonlinear controller and the fault estimation scheme.

AB No single instrument can characterize all soil properties because soil is a complex material. With the advancement of technology, laboratories have become equipped with various spectrometers. By fusing output from different spectrometers, better prediction outcomes are expected than using any single spectrometer alone. In this study, model performance from a single spectrometer (visible-near-infrared spectroscopy, vis-NIR or mid infrared spectroscopy, MIR) was compared to the combined spectrometers (vis-NIR and MIR). We selected a total of 14,594 samples from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) database that had both vis-NIR and MIR spectra along with measurements of sand, clay, total C (TC) content, organic C (OC) content, cation exchange capacity (CEC), and pH. The dataset was randomly split into 75% training (n = 10,946) and the remaining (n = 3,648) as a test set. Prediction models were constructed with partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Cubist tree model. Additionally, we explored the use of a deep learning model, the convolutional neural network (CNN). We investigated various ways to feed spectral data to the CNN, either as one-dimensional (1D) data (as a spectrum) or as two-dimensional (2D) data (as a spectrogram). Compared to the PLSR model, we found that the CNN model provides an average improvement prediction of 33-42% using vis-NIR and 30-43% using MIR spectral data input. The relative accuracy improvement of CNN, when compared to the Cubist regression tree model, ranged between 22 and 36% with vis-NIR and 16-27% with MIR spectral data input. Various methods to fuse the vis-NIR and MIR spectral data were explored. We compared the performance of spectral concatenation (for PLSR and Cubist model), two-channel input method, and outer product analysis (OPA) method (for CNN model). We found that the performance of two-channel 1D CNN model was the best (R-2 = 0.95-0.98) followed closely by the OPA with CNN (R-2 = 0.93-0.98), Cubist model with spectral concatenation (R-2 = 0.91-0.97), two-channel 2D CNN model (R-2 = 0.90-0.95) and PLSR with spectral concatenation (R-2 = 0.87-0.95). Chemometric analysis of spectroscopy data relied on spectral pre-processing methods: such as spectral trimming, baseline correction, smoothing, and normalization before being fed into the model. CNN achieved higher performance than the PLSR and Cubist model without utilizing the pre-processed spectral data. We also found that the predictions using the CNN model retained similar correlations to the actual values in comparison to other models. By doing sensitivity analysis, we identified the important spectral wavelengths variables used by the CNN model to predict various soil properties. CNN is an effective model for modelling soil properties from a large spectral library.

AB In this paper, we propose a two-phase test sample representation method for face recognition. The first phase of the proposed method seeks to represent the test sample as a linear combination of all the training samples and exploits the representation ability of each training sample to determine M "nearest neighbors" for the test sample. The second phase represents the test sample as a linear combination of the determined M nearest neighbors and uses the representation result to perform classification. We propose this method with the following assumption: the test sample and its some neighbors are probably from the same class. Thus, we use the first phase to detect the training samples that are far from the test sample and assume that these samples have no effects on the ultimate classification decision. This is helpful to accurately classify the test sample. We will also show the probability explanation of the proposed method. A number of face recognition experiments show that our method performs very well.

AB STUDY QUESTION: Can a deep learning model predict the probability of pregnancy with fetal heart (FH) from time-lapse videos?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: We created a deep learning model named IVY, which was an objective and fully automated system that predicts the probability of FH pregnancy directly from raw time-lapse videos without the need for any manual morphokinetic annotation or blastocyst morphology assessment.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The contribution of time-lapse imaging in effective embryo selection is promising. Existing algorithms for the analysis of time-lapse imaging are based on morphology and morphokinetic parameters that require subjective human annotation and thus have intrinsic inter-reader and intra-reader variability. Deep learning offers promise for the automation and standardization of embryo selection.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A retrospective analysis of time-lapse videos and clinical outcomes of 10 638 embryos from eight different IVF clinics, across four different countries, between January 2014 and December 2018.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The deep learning model was trained using time-lapse videos with known FH pregnancy outcome to perform a binary classification task of predicting the probability of pregnancy with FH given time-lapse video sequence. The predictive power of the model was measured using the average area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve over 5-fold stratified cross-validation.
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The deep learning model was able to predict FH pregnancy from time-lapse videos with an AUC of 0.93 [95% CI 0.92-0.94] in 5-fold stratified cross-validation. A hold-out validation test across eight laboratories showed that the AUC was reproducible, ranging from 0.95 to 0.90 across different laboratories with different culture and laboratory processes.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study is a retrospective analysis demonstrating that the deep learning model has a high level of predictability of the likelihood that an embryo will implant. The clinical impacts of these findings are still uncertain. Further studies, including prospective randomized controlled trials, are required to evaluate the clinical significance of this deep learning model. The time-lapse videos collected for training and validation are Day 5 embryos; hence, additional adjustment would need to be made for the model to be used in the context of Day 3 transfer.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The high predictive value for embryo implantation obtained by the deep learning model may improve the effectiveness of previous approaches used for time-lapse imaging in embryo selection. This may improve the prioritization of the most viable embryo for a single embryo transfer. The deep learning model may also prove to be useful in providing the optimal order for subsequent transfers of cryopreserved embryos.

AB VR is expected to be one of the killer applications in 5G networks. However, many technical bottlenecks and challenges need to be overcome to facilitate its wide adoption. In particular, VR requirements in terms of high throughput, low latency, and reliable communication call for innovative solutions and fundamental research cutting across several disciplines. In view of the above, this article discusses the challenges and enablers for ultra-reliable and low-latency VR. Furthermore, in an interactive VR gaming arcade case study, we show that a smart network design that leverages the use of mmWave communication, edge computing, and proactive caching can achieve the future vision of VR over wireless.

AB Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have attracted considerable interest in low-level computer vision. Researches are usually devoted to improving the performance via very deep CNNs. However, as the depth increases, influences of the shallow layers on deep layers are weakened. Inspired by the fact, we propose an attention-guided denoising convolutional neural network (ADNet), mainly including a sparse block (SB), a feature enhancement block (FEB), an attention block (AB) and a reconstruction block (RB) for image denoising. Specifically, the SB makes a tradeoff between performance and efficiency by using dilated and common convolutions to remove the noise. The FEB integrates global and local features information via a long path to enhance the expressive ability of the denoising model. The AB is used to finely extract the noise information hidden in the complex background, which is very effective for complex noisy images, especially real noisy images and bind denoising. Also, the FEB is integrated with the AB to improve the efficiency and reduce the complexity for training a denoising model. Finally, a RB aims to construct the clean image through the obtained noise mapping and the given noisy image. Additionally, comprehensive experiments show that the proposed ADNet performs very well in three tasks (i.e. synthetic and real noisy images, and blind denoising) in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have driven impressive advances in artificial intelligence in recent years, exceeding human performance in domains ranging from Atari to Go to no-limit poker. This progress has drawn the attention of cognitive scientists interested in understanding human learning. However, the concern has been raised that deep RL may be too sample-inefficient that is, it may simply be too slow - to provide a plausible model of how humans learn. In the present review, we counter this critique by describing recently developed techniques that allow deep RL to operate more nimbly, solving problems much more quickly than previous methods. Although these techniques were developed in an AI context, we propose that they may have rich implications for psychology and neuroscience. A key insight, arising from these AI methods, concerns the fundamental connection between fast RL and slower, more incremental forms of learning.

DE Hysteresis modeling; magnetic shape memory alloy (MSMA); neural network
AB Magnetic shape memory alloy (MSMA) based actuators are extensively applied in the fields of precision manufacturing and micro/nano technology. Nevertheless, the inherent hysteresis in the MSMA-based actuator severely hinders its further application. In this letter, the characteristics of hysteresis behavior under different input signals are investigated. Then, a nonlinear auto-regressive moving average with exogenous inputs (NARMAX) model based on a diagonal recurrent neural network (DRNN) is used to construct the rate-dependent hysteresis model. To improve the capability of characterizing the multi-valued mapping of the hysteresis loop, the play operator is adopted as the exogenous variable function of the NARMAX model. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, a series of comparisons are implemented. The experimental results show that the proposed NARMAX model based on the DRNN exhibits excellent modeling performance.

   ANALYSIS
AB The fifth generation (5G) wireless communication networks are being deployed worldwide from 2020 and more capabilities are in the process of being standardized, such as mass connectivity, ultra-reliability, and guaranteed low latency. However, 5G will not meet all requirements of the future in 2030 and beyond, and sixth generation (6G) wireless communication networks are expected to provide global coverage, enhanced spectral/energy/cost efficiency, better intelligence level and security, etc. To meet these requirements, 6G networks will rely on new enabling technologies, i.e., air interface and transmission technologies and novel network architecture, such as waveform design, multiple access, channel coding schemes, multi-antenna technologies, network slicing, cell-free architecture, and cloud/fog/edge computing. Our vision on 6G is that it will have four new paradigm shifts. First, to satisfy the requirement of global coverage, 6G will not be limited to terrestrial communication networks, which will need to be complemented with non-terrestrial networks such as satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks, thus achieving a space-air-ground-sea integrated communication network. Second, all spectra will be fully explored to further increase data rates and connection density, including the sub-6 GHz, millimeter wave (mmWave), terahertz (THz), and optical frequency bands. Third, facing the big datasets generated by the use of extremely heterogeneous networks, diverse communication scenarios, large numbers of antennas, wide bandwidths, and new service requirements, 6G networks will enable a new range of smart applications with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data technologies. Fourth, network security will have to be strengthened when developing 6G networks. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent advances and future trends in these four aspects. Clearly, 6G with additional technical requirements beyond those of 5G will enable faster and further communications to the extent that the boundary between physical and cyber worlds disappears.

AB The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic is causing a global health crisis. One of the effective protection methods is wearing a face mask in public areas according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In this paper, a hybrid model using deep and classical machine learning for face mask detection will be presented. The proposed model consists of two components. The first component is designed for feature extraction using Resnet50. While the second component is designed for the classification process of face masks using decision trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and ensemble algorithm. Three face masked datasets have been selected for investigation. The Three datasets are the Real-World Masked Face Dataset (RMFD), the Simulated Masked Face Dataset (SMFD), and the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW). The SVM classifier achieved 99.64% testing accuracy in RMFD. In SMFD, it achieved 99.49%, while in LFW, it achieved 100% testing accuracy.

AB This paper considers cooperative kinematic control of multiple manipulators using distributed recurrent neural networks and provides a tractable way to extend existing results on individual manipulator control using recurrent neural networks to the scenario with the coordination of multiple manipulators. The problem is formulated as a constrained game, where energy consumptions for each manipulator, saturations of control input, and the topological constraints imposed by the communication graph are considered. An implicit form of the Nash equilibrium for the game is obtained by converting the problem into its dual space. Then, a distributed dynamic controller based on recurrent neural networks is devised to drive the system toward the desired Nash equilibrium to seek the optimal solution of the cooperative control. Global stability and solution optimality of the proposed neural networks are proved in the theory. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Predicting history-dependent materials' responses is crucial, as path-dependent behavior appears while characterizing or geometrically designing many materials (e.g., metallic and polymeric cellular materials), and it takes place in manufacturing and processing of many materials (e.g., metal solidification). Such phenomena can be computationally intensive and challenging when numerical schemes such as the finite element method are used. Here, we have applied a variety of sequence learning models to almost instantly predict the history-dependent responses (stresses and energy) of a class of cellular materials as well as the multiphysics problem of steel solidification with multiple thermo-viscoplasticity constitutive models accounting for substantial temperature, time, and path dependencies, and phase transformation. We have shown the gated recurrent unit (GRU) as well as the temporal convolutional network (TCN), can both accurately learn and almost instantly predict these irreversible, and historyand time-dependent phenomena, while TCN is more computationally efficient during the training process. This work may open the door for the broader adoption of data-driven models in similar computationally challenging constitutive models in plasticity and inelasticity.

AB Having accurate, detailed, and up-to-date information about the location and behavior of animals in the wild would improve our ability to study and conserve ecosystems. We investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collect such data, which could help catalyze the transformation of many fields of ecology, wildlife biology, zoology, conservation biology, and animal behavior into "big data" sciences. Motion-sensor "camera traps" enable collecting wildlife pictures inexpensively, unobtrusively, and frequently. However, extracting information from these pictures remains an expensive, time-consuming, manual task. We demonstrate that such information can be automatically extracted by deep learning, a cutting-edge type of artificial intelligence. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2 million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with >93.8% accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3% of the data while still performing at the same 96.6% accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving >8.4 y (i.e., >17,000 h at 40 h/wk) of human labeling effort on this 3.2 million-image dataset. Those efficiency gains highlight the importance of using deep neural networks to automate data extraction from camera-trap images, reducing a roadblock for this widely used technology. Our results suggest that deep learning could enable the inexpensive, unobtrusive, high-volume, and even real-time collection of a wealth of information about vast numbers of animals in the wild.

AB In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), particularly for small UAVs, due to their affordable prices, wide availability, and relative ease of operability. Existing and future applications of UAVs include remote surveillance and monitoring, relief operations, package delivery, and communication back-haul infrastructure. Additionally, UAVs are envisioned as an important component of 5G wireless technology and beyond. The unique application scenarios for UAVs necessitate accurate air-to-ground (AG) propagation channel models for designing and evaluating UAV communication links for control/non-payload as well as payload data transmissions. These AG propagation models have not been investigated in detail, relative to terrestrial propagation models. In this paper, a comprehensive survey is provided on available AG channel measurement campaigns, large and small scale fading channel models, their limitations, and future research directions for UAV communication scenarios.

DE COVID-19; X-ray imaging; Deep learning; Transfer learning
AB The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a major outbreak in more than 150 countries around the world, having a severe impact on the health and life of many people globally. One of the crucial step in fighting COVID-19 is the ability to detect the infected patients early enough, and put them under special care. Detecting this disease from radiography and radiology images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose the patients. Some of the early studies showed specific abnormalities in the chest radiograms of patients infected with COVID-19. Inspired by earlier works, we study the application of deep learning models to detect COVID-19 patients from their chest radiography images. We first prepare a dataset of 50 0 0 Chest X-rays from the publicly available datasets. Images exhibiting COVID-19 disease presence were identified by board-certified radiologist. Transfer learning on a subset of 20 0 0 radiograms was used to train four popular convolutional neural networks, including ResNet18, ResNet50, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121, to identify COVID-19 disease in the analyzed chest X-ray images. We evaluated these models on the remaining 30 0 0 images, and most of these networks achieved a sensitivity rate of 98% ( +/- 3%), while having a specificity rate of around 90%. Besides sensitivity and specificity rates, we also present the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve, average prediction, and confusion matrix of each model. We also used a technique to generate heatmaps of lung regions potentially infected by COVID-19 and show that the generated heatmaps contain most of the infected areas annotated by our board certified radiologist. While the achieved performance is very encouraging, further analysis is required on a larger set of COVID-19 images, to have a more reliable estimation of accuracy rates. The dataset, model implementations (in PyTorch), and evaluations, are all made publicly available for research community at https://github.com/shervinmin/DeepCovid.git (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Despite a number of studies about how natural environments can affect human health and well-being, few have examined the potentially different effects of different types of vegetation. We therefore designed and conducted a randomised controlled experiment to identify the restorative potential of different types of trees and grass in an urban virtual reality (VR) environment. We initially induced stress in participants (n = 89) by asking them to complete a 5-minute math test while listening to noise, after which they were randomly assigned each to one of three VR environments: a courtyard with grass, a courtyard with trees, or a courtyard devoid of any vegetation. Participants were immersed in the VR experience for 10 min, during which we measured skin conductance levels (SCLs). We also assessed participants' positive and negative affect scores at baseline, before VR immersion, and after VR immersion. Repeated-measures analysis of variance with a general linear model indicated that the grassy environment had the greatest effect on positive affect. SCLs during the second half of VR immersion were significantly lower in both the grass and tree environments than in the concrete-only environment. Our results are consistent with Ulrich's theory that unlearned factors of evolutionary origin influence affective responses to environments. Our findings provide preliminary practical evidence for landscape planning that can maximise the restorative effects of urban environments.

AB Tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of electrode materials, electrolytes, and separators of energy-storage devices to address the fundamental needs of emerging technologies such as electric vehicles, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. However, binders, as an important component of energy-storage devices, are yet to receive similar attention. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has been the dominant binder in the battery industry for decades despite several well-recognized drawbacks, i.e., limited binding strength due to the lack of chemical bonds with electroactive materials, insufficient mechanical properties, and low electronic and lithium-ion conductivities. The limited binding function cannot meet inherent demands of emerging electrode materials with high capacities such as silicon anodes and sulfur cathodes. To address these concerns, in this review we divide the binding between active materials and binders into two major mechanisms: mechanical interlocking and interfacial binding forces. We review existing and emerging binders, binding technology used in energy-storage devices (including lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors), and state-of-the-art mechanical characterization and computational methods for binder research. Finally, we propose prospective next-generation binders for energy-storage devices from the molecular level to the macro level. Functional binders will play crucial roles in future high-performance energy-storage devices.

AB In the current study, various evolutionary artificial intelligence and machine learning models namely, optimized artificial neural network (ANN), genetic algorithm optimized with ANN (GA-ANN) and particle swarm optimization optimized with ANN (PSO-ANN), differential evolution algorithm (DEA), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), general regression neural network (GRNN), and feedforward neural network (FFNN) were optimized and applied to predict the ultimate bearing capacity (F-ult) of shallow footing on two-layered soil condition. Due to a lot of input variables such as (upper layer thickness/foundation width (h/B) ratio, footing width (B), top and bottom soil layer properties) finding a reliable solution for such a complex engineering problem is difficult. Most of the available solutions are based on very limited experimental works. To assess the capability of proposed methods a new ranking system called CER (color intensity rating) based on their result of above indices was developed. As a result, although all provided methods, after being optimized, could successfully predict the bearing capacity of shallow footing in the two-layer subsoil and PSO-ANN could perform better compared to other techniques. Based on RMSE, R-2 and VAF, values of (0.01, 0.99, and 99.90) and (0.01, 0.99, and 99.90) were found, respectively, for the training and testing datasets of PSO-ANN model. In this regard, the accuracy of other hybrid algorithm of GA-ANN model with RMSE, R-2 and VAF of (0.05, 0.99, and 97.80) and (0.06, 0.99, and 97.57), respectively, for the training and testing datasets was slightly lower than the PSO-ANN model. This shows the superiority of the PSO-ANN model in the prediction of a highly complex real-world engineering problem.

However, most of the previous studies attempting to build traffic flow forecasting models focus on short-term forecasting as the next step. In this paper, a deep feature leaning approach is proposed to predict short-term traffic flow in the following multiple steps using supervised learning techniques. To achieve traffic flow forecasting for the next day, an advanced multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to optimize some parameters in deep belief networks. The modified model can boost the accuracy of the forecasting results and enhance its multiple step prediction ability. Using real-time and historical temporal-spatial traffic data, dayahead prediction experiment is implemented. The results of the hybrid model are compared with several commonly used benchmark models and some improved deep neural network based on evaluation criteria. Also, the proposed optimization algorithm is compared with the traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the significance in the number of hidden layers is analyzed. When the layers are increasing more than 4, the performance of the proposed model stops improving significantly. The results indicate the proposed model can extract complex features of traffic flow and therefore the forecasting accuracy and stability can be effectively improved. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Deep learning, which represents data by a hierarchical network, has proven to be efficient in computer vision. To investigate the effect of deep features in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, this paper focuses on how to extract and utilize deep features in HSI classification framework. First, in order to extract spectral-spatial information, an improved deep network, spatial updated deep auto-encoder (SDAE), is proposed. SDAE, which is an improved deep auto-encoder (DAE), considers sample similarity by adding a regularization term in the energy function, and updates features by integrating contextual information. Second, in order to deal with the small training set using deep features, a collaborative representation-based classification is applied. Moreover, in order to suppress salt-and-pepper noise and smooth the result, we compute the residual of collaborative representation of all samples as a residual matrix, which can be effectively used in a graph-cut-based spatial regularization. The proposed method inherits the advantages of deep learning and has solutions to add spatial information of HSI in the learning network. Using collaborative representation-based classification with deep features makes the proposed classifier extremely robust under a small training set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method provides encouraging results compared with some related techniques.

AB Video based facial expression recognition has been a long standing problem and attracted growing attention recently. The key to a successful facial expression recognition system is to exploit the potentials of audiovisual modalities and design robust features to effectively characterize the facial appearance and configuration changes caused by facial motions. We propose an effective framework to address this issue in this paper. In our study, both visual modalities (face images) and audio modalities (speech) are utilized. A new feature descriptor called Histogram of Oriented Gradients from Three Orthogonal Planes (HOG-TOP) is proposed to extract dynamic textures from video sequences to characterize facial appearance changes. And a new effective geometric feature derived from the warp transformation of facial landmarks is proposed to capture facial configuration changes. Moreover, the role of audio modalities on recognition is also explored in our study. We applied the multiple feature fusion to tackle the video-based facial expression recognition problems under lab-controlled environment and in the wild, respectively. Experiments conducted on the extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database and the Acted Facial Expression in Wild (AFEW) 4.0 database show that our approach is robust in dealing with video-based facial expression recognition problems under lab-controlled environment and in the wild compared with the other state-of-the-art methods.

AB Purpose: To develop and validate a deep learning-based automatic detection algorithm (DLAD) for malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs and to compare its performance with physicians including thoracic radiologists.
   Materials and Methods: For this retrospective study, DLAD was developed by using 43 292 chest radiographs (normal radiograph-to-nodule radiograph ratio, 34 067: 9225) in 34 676 patients (healthy-to-nodule ratio, 30 784: 3892; 19 230 men [mean age, 52.8 years; age range, 18-99 years]; 15 446 women [mean age, 52.3 years; age range, 18-98 years]) obtained between 2010 and 2015, which were labeled and partially annotated by 13 board-certified radiologists, in a convolutional neural network. Radiograph classification and nodule detection performances of DLAD were validated by using one internal and four external data sets from three South Korean hospitals and one U.S. hospital. For internal and external validation, radiograph classification and nodule detection performances of DLAD were evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic (JAFROC) figure of merit (FOM), respectively. An observer performance test involving 18 physicians, including nine board-certified radiologists, was conducted by using one of the four external validation data sets. Performances of DLAD, physicians, and physicians assisted with DLAD were evaluated and compared.
   Results: According to one internal and four external validation data sets, radiograph classification and nodule detection performances of DLAD were a range of 0.92-0.99 (AUROC) and 0.831-0.924 (JAFROC FOM), respectively. DLAD showed a higher AUROC and JAFROC FOM at the observer performance test than 17 of 18 and 15 of 18 physicians, respectively (P<.05), and all physicians showed improved nodule detection performances with DLAD (mean JAFROC FOM improvement, 0.043; range, 0.006-0.190; P<.05).
   Conclusion: This deep learning-based automatic detection algorithm outperformed physicians in radiograph classification and nodule detection performance for malignant pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs, and it enhanced physicians' performances when used as a second reader. (c) RSNA, 2018

AB The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.

AB At the dawn of the fourth industrial revolution, we are witnessing a fast and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in our daily life, which contributes to accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society. However, even with such unprecedented advancements, a key impediment to the use of AI-based systems is that they often lack transparency. Indeed, the black-box nature of these systems allows powerful predictions, but it cannot be directly explained. This issue has triggered a new debate on explainable AI (XAI). A research field holds substantial promise for improving trust and transparency of AI-based systems. It is recognized as the sine qua non for AI to continue making steady progress without disruption. This survey provides an entry point for interested researchers and practitioners to learn key aspects of the young and rapidly growing body of research related to XAI. Through the lens of the literature, we review the existing approaches regarding the topic, discuss trends surrounding its sphere, and present major research trajectories.

AB The emergent machine learning technique-extreme learning machines (ELMs)-has become a hot area of research over the past years, which is attributed to the growing research activities and significant contributions made by numerous researchers around the world. Recently, it has come to our attention that a number of misplaced notions and misunderstandings are being dissipated on the relationships between ELM and some earlier works. This paper wishes to clarify that (1) ELM theories manage to address the open problem which has puzzled the neural networks, machine learning and neuroscience communities for 60 years: whether hidden nodes/neurons need to be tuned in learning, and proved that in contrast to the common knowledge and conventional neural network learning tenets, hidden nodes/neurons do not need to be iteratively tuned in wide types of neural networks and learning models (Fourier series, biological learning, etc.). Unlike ELM theories, none of those earlier works provides theoretical foundations on feedforward neural networks with random hidden nodes; (2) ELM is proposed for both generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward network and multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks (including biological neural networks); (3) homogeneous architecture-based ELM is proposed for feature learning, clustering, regression and (binary/multi-class) classification. (4) Compared to ELM, SVM and LS-SVM tend to provide suboptimal solutions, and SVM and LS-SVM do not consider feature representations in hidden layers of multi-hidden-layer feedforward networks either.

AB Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has been an important tool in neuroscience with applications in neuroscience, neural engineering (e.g. Brain-computer interfaces, BCI's), and even commercial applications. Many of the analytical tools used in EEG studies have used machine learning to uncover relevant information for neural classification and neuroimaging. Recently, the availability of large EEG data sets and advances in machine learning have both led to the deployment of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of EEG signals and in understanding the information it may contain for brain functionality. The robust automatic classification of these signals is an important step towards making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less reliant on trained professionals. Towards this goal, a systematic review of the literature on deep learning applications to EEG classification was performed to address the following critical questions: (1) Which EEG classification tasks have been explored with deep learning? (2) What input formulations have been used for training the deep networks? (3) Are there specific deep learning network structures suitable for specific types of tasks? Approach. A systematic literature review of EEG classification using deep learning was performed on Web of Science and PubMed databases, resulting in 90 identified studies. Those studies were analyzed based on type of task, EEG preprocessing methods, input type, and deep learning architecture. Main results. For EEG classification tasks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, deep belief networks outperform stacked auto-encoders and multi-layer perceptron neural networks in classification accuracy. The tasks that used deep learning fell into five general groups: emotion recognition, motor imagery, mental workload, seizure detection, event related potential detection, and sleep scoring. For each type of task, we describe the specific input formulation, major characteristics, and end classifier recommendations found through this review.
   Significance. This review summarizes the current practices and performance outcomes in the use of deep learning for EEG classification. Practical suggestions on the selection of many hyperparameters are provided in the hope that they will promote or guide the deployment of deep learning to EEG datasets in future research.

AB Advances in computer vision and the parallel development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) allow for the extensive use of UAV in forest inventory and in indirect measurements of tree features. We used UAV-sensed high-resolution imagery through photogrammetry and Structure from Motion (SfM) to estimate tree heights and crown diameters. We reconstructed 3D structures from 2D image sequences for two study areas (25 x 25 m). Species composition for Plot 1 included Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) together with European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), whereas Plot 2 was mainly Norway spruce and Scots pine together with scattered individuals of European larch and Silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.). The involved workflow used canopy height models (CHMs) for the extraction of height, the smoothing of raster images for the determination of the local maxima, and Inverse Watershed Segmentation (IWS) for the estimation of the crown diameters with the help of a geographical information system (GIS). Finally, we validated the accuracies of the two methods by comparing the UAV results with ground measurements. The results showed higher agreement between field and remote-sensed data for heights than for crown diameters based on RMSE%, which were in the range 11.42-12.62 for height and 14.29-18.56 for crown diameter. Overall, the accuracy of the results was acceptable and showed that the methods were feasible for detecting tree heights and crown diameter.

TI Quantum Loop Topography for Machine Learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS

DT Article
ID ANYONS; COMPUTATION; LIQUIDS
AB Despite rapidly growing interest in harnessing machine learning in the study of quantum many-body systems, training neural networks to identify quantum phases is a nontrivial challenge. The key challenge is in efficiently extracting essential information from the many-body Hamiltonian or wave function and turning the information into an image that can be fed into a neural network. When targeting topological phases, this task becomes particularly challenging as topological phases are defined in terms of nonlocal properties. Here, we introduce quantum loop topography (QLT): a procedure of constructing a multidimensional image from the "sample" Hamiltonian or wave function by evaluating two-point operators that form loops at independent Monte Carlo steps. The loop configuration is guided by the characteristic response for defining the phase, which is Hall conductivity for the cases at hand. Feeding QLT to a fully connected neural network with a single hidden layer, we demonstrate that the architecture can be effectively trained to distinguish the Chern insulator and the fractional Chern insulator from trivial insulators with high fidelity. In addition to establishing the first case of obtaining a phase diagram with a topological quantum phase transition with machine learning, the perspective of bridging traditional condensed matter theory with machine learning will be broadly valuable.

AB The primary purpose of this study was to develop a novel hybrid artificial intelligence model, with a robust performance, to predict ground vibration induced by bench blasting. An artificial neural network (ANN) was combined with the firefly algorithm (FFA), abbreviated as an FFA-ANN model, for this objective. To develop the FFA-ANN model, an ANN model (i.e., ANN 5-16-20-1) was established first; its weights and biases were then optimized by the FFA. A classification and regression tree (CART), a k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and a support vector machine (SVM) were also developed to confirm the power of the proposed FFA-ANN model. Eighty-three blasting events at a quarry mine in Vietnam were investigated to assess the danger of ground vibration through the developed models. The quality of the developed models was assessed through root-mean-squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of correlation (R-2), and variance account for. A simple ranking method and color gradient technique were also applied to evaluate the performance of the models. The results of this study indicated that the proposed FFA-ANN model was the most dominant model in comparison with other models (i.e., CART, SVM, KNN). The results also demonstrated that the FFA has a vital role in optimizing the ANN model in predicting blast-induced ground vibration.

AB BOTS (SHORT FOR software robots) have been around since the early days of computers. One compelling example of bots is chatbots, algorithms designed to hold a conversation with a human, as envisioned by Alan Turing in the 1950s.(33) The dream of designing a computer algorithm that passes the Turing test has driven artificial intelligence research for decades, as witnessed by initiatives like the Loebner Prize, awarding progress in natural language processing. a Many things have changed since the early days of AI, when bots like Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA,(39) mimicking a Rogerian psychotherapist, were developed as demonstrations or for delight.
   Today, social media ecosystems populated by hundreds of millions of individuals present real incentives-including economic and political ones-

AB Machines are increasingly doing "intelligent" things. Face recognition algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function that predicts the presence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: How do these new empirical tools fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Machine learning not only provides new tools, it solves a different problem. Specifically, machine learning revolves around the problem of prediction, while many economic applications revolve around parameter estimation. So applying machine learning to economics requires finding relevant tasks. Machine learning algorithms are now technically easy to use: you can download convenient packages in R or Python. This also raises the risk that the algorithms are applied naively or their output is misinterpreted. We hope to make them conceptually easier to use by providing a crisper understanding of how these algorithms work, where they excel, and where they can stumble-and thus where they can be most usefully applied.

AB It has been well recognized that human driver's limits, heterogeneity, and selfishness substantially compromise the performance of our urban transport systems. In recent years, in order to deal with these deficiencies, our urban transport systems have been transforming with the blossom of key vehicle technology innovations, most notably, connected and automated vehicles. In this paper, we develop a car following model for electric, connected and automated vehicles based on reinforcement learning with the aim to dampen traffic oscillations (stop-and-go traffic waves) caused by human drivers and improve electric energy consumption. Compared to classical modelling approaches, the proposed reinforcement learning based model significantly reduces the modelling constraints and has the capability of self-learning and self-correction. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to improve travel efficiency by reducing the negative impact of traffic oscillations, and it can also reduce the average electric energy consumption.

AB Volatility plays crucial roles in financial markets, such as in derivative pricing, portfolio risk management, and hedging strategies. Therefore, accurate prediction of volatility is critical. We propose a new hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM) model to forecast stock price volatility that combines the LSTM model with various generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)-type models. We use KOSPI 200 index data to discover proposed hybrid models that combine an LSTM with one to three GARCH-type models. In addition, we compare their performance with existing methodologies by analyzing single models, such as the GARCH, exponential GARCH, exponentially weighted moving average, a deep feedforward neural network (DFN), and the LSTM, as well as the hybrid DFN models combining a DFN with one GARCH-type model. Their performance is compared with that of the proposed hybrid LSTM models. We discover that GEW-LSTM, a proposed hybrid model combining the LSTM model with three GARCH-type models, has the lowest prediction errors in terms of mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), heteroscedasticity adjusted MAE (HMAE), and heteroscedasticity adjusted MSE (HMSE). The MAE of GEW-ISTM is 0.0107, which is 37.2% less than that of the E-DFN (0.017), the model combining EGARCH and DFN and the best model among those existing. In addition, the GEW-LSTM has 57.3%, 24.7%, and 48% smaller MSE, HMAE, and HMSE, respectively. The first contribution of this study is its hybrid LSTM model that combines excellent sequential pattern learning with improved prediction performance In stock market volatility. Second, our proposed model markedly enhances prediction performance of the existing literature by combining a neural network model with multiple econometric models rather than only a single econometric model. Finally, the proposed methodology can be extended to various fields as an integrated model combining time-series and neural network models as well as forecasting stock market volatility.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted significant attentions in the fifth generation mobile networks and the smart cities. However, considering the large numbers of connectivity demands, it is vital to improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) of the IoT with an affordable power consumption. To improve the SE, the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is newly proposed through accommodating multiple users in the same spectrums. As a result, in this paper, an energy efficient resource allocation (RA) problem is introduced for the NOMA-based heterogeneous IoT. At first, we assume the successive interference cancelation (SIC) is imperfect for practical implementations. Then, based on the analyzing method for cognitive radio networks, we present a stepwise RA scheme for the mobile users and the IoT users with the mutual interference management. Third, we propose a deep recurrent neural network-based algorithm to solve the problem optimally and rapidly. Moreover, a priorities and rate demands-based user scheduling method is supplemented, to coordinate the access of the heterogeneous users with the limited radio resource. At last, the simulation results verify that the deep learning-based scheme is able to provide optimal RA results for the NOMA heterogeneous IoT with fast convergence and low computational complexity. Compared with the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiple access system, the NOMA system with imperfect SIC yields better performance on the SE and the scale of connectivity, at the cost of high power consumption and low energy efficiency.

AB How does one find objects in scenes? For decades, visual search models have been built on experiments in which observers search for targets, presented among distractor items, isolated and randomly arranged on blank backgrounds. Are these models relevant to search in continuous scenes? This article argues that the mechanisms that govern artificial, laboratory search tasks do play a role in visual search in scenes. However, scene-based information is used to guide search in ways that had no place in earlier models. Search in scenes might be best explained by a dual-path model: a 'selective' path in which candidate objects must be individually selected for recognition and a 'nonselective' path in which information can be extracted from global and/or statistical information.

ID BAND SELECTION; SPECIAL-ISSUE; FOREWORD; REPRESENTATION
AB As a powerful visual model, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various visual recognition problems, and attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, due to the highly correlated bands and insufficient training samples of hyperspectral image data, it still remains a challenging problem to effectively apply the CNN models on hyperspectral images. In this paper, an efficient CNN architecture has been proposed to boost its discriminative capability for hyperspectral image classification, in which the original data is used as the input and the final CNN outputs are the predicted class-related results. The proposed CNN infrastructure has several distinct advantages. Firstly, different from traditional classification methods those need hand-crafted features, the CNN model used here is designed to deal with the problem of hyperspectral image analysis in an end-to-end way. Secondly, the parameters of the CNN model are optimized from a small training set, while the over-fitting problem of the neural network has been alleviated to some extent. Finally, in order to better deal with the hyperspectral image information, 1 x 1 convolutional layers have been adopted, and an average pooling layer and larger dropout rates have also been employed in the whole CNN procedure. The experiments on three benchmark data sets have demonstrated that the proposed CNN architecture considerably outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Many classic and contemporary face recognition algorithms work well on public data sets, but degrade sharply when they are used in a real recognition system. This is mostly due to the difficulty of simultaneously handling variations in illumination, image misalignment, and occlusion in the test image. We consider a scenario where the training images are well controlled and test images are only loosely controlled. We propose a conceptually simple face recognition system that achieves a high degree of robustness and stability to illumination variation, image misalignment, and partial occlusion. The system uses tools from sparse representation to align a test face image to a set of frontal training images. The region of attraction of our alignment algorithm is computed empirically for public face data sets such as Multi-PIE. We demonstrate how to capture a set of training images with enough illumination variation that they span test images taken under uncontrolled illumination. In order to evaluate how our algorithms work under practical testing conditions, we have implemented a complete face recognition system, including a projector-based training acquisition system. Our system can efficiently and effectively recognize faces under a variety of realistic conditions, using only frontal images under the proposed illuminations as training.

AB We present a novel framework to generate and rank plausible hypotheses for the spatial extent of objects in images using bottom-up computational processes and mid-level selection cues. The object hypotheses are represented as figure-ground segmentations, and are extracted automatically, without prior knowledge of the properties of individual object classes, by solving a sequence of Constrained Parametric Min-Cut problems (CPMC) on a regular image grid. In a subsequent step, we learn to rank the corresponding segments by training a continuous model to predict how likely they are to exhibit real-world regularities (expressed as putative overlap with ground truth) based on their mid-level region properties, then diversify the estimated overlap score using maximum marginal relevance measures. We show that this algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art for low-level segmentation in the VOC 2009 and 2010 data sets. In our companion papers [1], [2], we show that the algorithm can be used, successfully, in a segmentation-based visual object category recognition pipeline. This architecture ranked first in the VOC2009 and VOC2010 image segmentation and labeling challenges.

AB Aftershocks are a response to changes in stress generated by large earthquakes and represent the most common observations of the triggering of earthquakes. The maximum magnitude of aftershocks and their temporal decay are well described by empirical laws (such as Bath's law(1) and Omori's law(2)), but explaining and forecasting the spatial distribution of aftershocks is more difficult. Coulomb failure stress change(3) is perhaps the most widely used criterion to explain the spatial distributions of aftershocks(4-8), but its applicability has been disputed(9-11). Here we use a deep-learning approach to identify a static-stress-based criterion that forecasts aftershock locations without prior assumptions about fault orientation. We show that a neural network trained on more than 131,000 mainshock-aftershock pairs can predict the locations of aftershocks in an independent test dataset of more than 30,000 mainshock-aftershock pairs more accurately (area under curve of 0.849) than can classic Coulomb failure stress change (area under curve of 0.583). We find that the learned aftershock pattern is physically interpretable: the maximum change in shear stress, the von Mises yield criterion (a scaled version of the second invariant of the deviatoric stress-change tensor) and the sum of the absolute values of the independent components of the stress-change tensor each explain more than 98 per cent of the variance in the neural-network prediction. This machine-learning-driven insight provides improved forecasts of aftershock locations and identifies physical quantities that may control earthquake triggering during the most active part of the seismic cycle.

AB The potential of visible and near infrared hyperspectral imaging was investigated as a rapid and nondestructive technique for classifying fresh and frozen-thawed meats by integrating critical spectral and image features extracted from hyperspectral images in the region of 400-1000 nm. Six feature wavelengths (400, 446, 477, 516, 592 and 686 nm) were identified using uninformative variable elimination and successive projections algorithm. Image textural features of the principal component images from hyperspectral images were obtained using histogram statistics (HS), gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix (GLGCM). By these spectral and textural features, probabilistic neural network (PNN) models for classification of fresh and frozen-thawed pork meats were established. Compared with the models using the optimum wavelengths only, optimum wavelengths with HS image features, and optimum wavelengths with GLCM image features, the model integrating optimum wavelengths with GLGCM gave the highest classification rate of 93.14% and 90.91% for calibration and validation sets, respectively. Results indicated that the classification accuracy can be improved by combining spectral features with textural features and the fusion of critical spectral and textural features had better potential than single spectral extraction in classifying fresh and frozen-thawed pork meat.

AB Change detection (CD) in multitemporal images is an important application of remote sensing. Recent technological evolution provided very high spatial resolution (VHR) multitemporal optical satellite images showing high spatial correlation among pixels and requiring an effective modeling of spatial context to accurately capture change information. Here, we propose a novel unsupervised context-sensitive framework-deep change vector analysis (DCVA)-for CD in multitemporal VHR images that exploit convolutional neural network (CNN) features. To have an unsupervised system, DCVA starts from a suboptimal pretrained multilayered CNN for obtaining deep features that can model spatial relationship among neighboring pixels and thus complex objects. An automatic feature selection strategy is employed layerwise to select features emphasizing both high and low prior probability change information. Selected features from multiple layers are combined into a deep feature hypervector providing a multiscale scene representation. The use of the same pretrained CNN for semantic segmentation of single images enables us to obtain coherent multitemporal deep feature hypervectors that can be compared pixelwise to obtain deep change vectors that also model spatial context information. Deep change vectors are analyzed based on their magnitude to identify changed pixels. Then, deep change vectors corresponding to identified changed pixels are binarized to obtain a compressed binary deep change vectors that preserve information about the direction (kind) of change. Changed pixels are analyzed for multiple CD based on the binary features, thus implicitly using the spatial information. Experimental results on multitemporal data sets ofWorldview-2, Pleiades, and Quickbird images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM), which was originally proposed for "generalized" single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs), provides efficient unified learning solutions for the applications of feature learning, clustering, regression and classification. Different from the common understanding and tenet that hidden neurons of neural networks need to be iteratively adjusted during training stage, ELM theories show that hidden neurons are important but need not be iteratively tuned. In fact, all the parameters of hidden nodes can be independent of training samples and randomly generated according to any continuous probability distribution. And the obtained ELM networks satisfy universal approximation and classification capability. The fully connected ELM architecture has been extensively studied. However, ELM with local connections has not attracted much research attention yet. This paper studies the general architecture of locally connected ELM, showing that: 1) ELM theories are naturally valid for local connections, thus introducing local receptive fields to the input layer; 2) each hidden node in ELM can be a combination of several hidden nodes (a subnetwork), which is also consistent with ELM theories. ELM theories may shed a light on the research of different local receptive fields including true biological receptive fields of which the exact shapes and formula may be unknown to human beings. As a specific example of such general architectures, random convolutional nodes and a pooling structure are implemented in this paper. Experimental results on the NORB dataset, a benchmark for object recognition, show that compared with conventional deep learning solutions, the proposed local receptive fields based ELM (ELM-LRF) reduces the error rate from 6.5% to 2.7% and increases the learning speed up to 200 times.

AB Recognition of epileptic seizures from offline EEG signals is very important in clinical diagnosis of epilepsy. Compared with manual labeling of EEG signals by doctors, machine learning approaches can be faster and more consistent. However, the classification accuracy is usually not satisfactory for two main reasons: the distributions of the data used for training and testing may be different, and the amount of training data may not be enough. In addition, most machine learning approaches generate black-box models that are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we integrate transductive transfer learning, semi-supervised learning and TSK fuzzy system to tackle these three problems. More specifically, we use transfer learning to reduce the discrepancy in data distribution between the training and testing data, employ semi-supervised learning to use the unlabeled testing data to remedy the shortage of training data, and adopt TSK fuzzy system to increase model interpretability. Two learning algorithms are proposed to train the system. Our experimental results show that the proposed approaches can achieve better performance than many state-of-the-art seizure classification algorithms.

AB We study the problem of photo cropping, which aims to find a cropping window of an input image to preserve as much as possible its important parts while being aesthetically pleasant. Seeking a deep learning-based solution, we design a neural network that has two branches for attention box prediction (ABP) and aesthetics assessment (AA), respectively. Given the input image, the ABP network predicts an attention bounding box as an initial minimum cropping window, around which a set of cropping candidates are generated with little loss of important information. Then, the AA network is employed to select the final cropping window with the best aesthetic quality among the candidates. The two sub-networks are designed to share the same full-image convolutional feature map, and thus are computationally efficient. By leveraging attention prediction and aesthetics assessment, the cropping model produces high-quality cropping results, even with the limited availability of training data for photo cropping. The experimental results on benchmark datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. In addition, our approach runs at 5 fps, outperforming most previous solutions. The code and results are available at: https://github.com/shenjianbing/DeepCropping.

AB Visual content analysis of tourist photos is an effective way to excavate tourist behavior and explore tourists' cognition in the tourism destination. With the development of computer deep learning and big data mining technology, identifying the content of massive numbers of tourist photos by Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches breaks through the limitations of manual approaches of identifying photos' visual information, e.g. small sample size, complex identification process and results deviation. In this study, 35,356 Flickr tourists' photos in Beijing were identified into 103 scenes by computer deep learning technology. Comparison through statistical analysis for behaviors and perceptions of tourists from different continents and countries was conducted. Tourists' cognitive maps with different perceptual themes were visualized according to photos' geographical information by ArcGIS. The field of how to apply AI technology into tourism destination research was explored and extended by this trial study.

AB Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is the collection of medical devices and related applications which link the healthcare IT systems through online computer networks. In the field of diagnosis, medical image classification plays an important role in prediction and early diagnosis of critical diseases. Medical images form an indispensable part of a patient & x2019;s health record which can be applied to control, handle and treat the diseases. But, classification of images is a challenging task in computer-based diagnostics. In this research article, we have introduced a improved classifier i.e., Optimal Deep Learning (DL) for classification of lung cancer, brain image, and Alzheimer & x2019;s disease. The researchers proposed the Optimal Feature Selection based Medical Image Classification using DL model by incorporating preprocessing, feature selection and classification. The main goal of the paper is to derive an optimal feature selection model for effective medical image classification. To enhance the performance of the DL classifier, Opposition-based Crow Search (OCS) algorithm is proposed. The OCS algorithm picks the optimal features from pre-processed images, here Multi-texture, grey level features were selected for the analysis. Finally, the optimal features improved the classification result and increased the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of medical images. The proposed results were implemented in MATLAB and compared with existing feature selection models and other classification approaches. The proposed model achieved the maximum performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity being 95.22 & x0025;, 86.45 & x0025; and 100 & x0025; for the applied set of images.

AB Image segmentation is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Despite many years of research, general purpose image segmentation is still a very challenging task because segmentation is inherently ill-posed. Among different segmentation schemes, graph theoretical ones have several good features in practical applications. It explicitly organizes the image elements into mathematically sound structures, and makes the formulation of the problem more flexible and the computation more efficient. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey of graph theoretical methods for image segmentation, where the problem is modeled in terms of partitioning a graph into several sub-graphs such that each of them represents a meaningful object of interest in the image. These methods are categorized into five classes under a uniform notation: the minimal spanning tree based methods, graph cut based methods with cost functions, graph cut based methods on Markov random field models, the shortest path based methods and the other methods that do not belong to any of these classes. We present motivations and detailed technical descriptions for each category of methods. The quantitative evaluation is carried by using five indices - Probabilistic Rand (PR) index, Normalized Probabilistic Rand (NPR) index, Variation of Information (VI), Global Consistency Error (GCE) and Boundary Displacement Error (BDE) - on some representative automatic and interactive segmentation methods.

AB Hydrogels, which are hydrophilic soft porous networks, are an important class of materials of broad relevance to bioanalytical chemistry, soft-robotics, drug delivery, and regenerative medicine. Transformer hydrogels are micro-and mesostructured hydrogels that display a dramatic transformation of shape, form, or dimension with associated changes in function, due to engineered local variations such as in swelling or stiffness, in response to external controls or environmental stimuli. This review describes principles that can be utilized to fabricate transformer hydrogels such as by layering, patterning, or generating anisotropy, and gradients. Transformer hydrogels are classified based on their responsivity to different stimuli such as temperature, electromagnetic fields, chemicals, and biomolecules. A survey of the current research progress suggests applications of transformer hydrogels in biomimetics, soft robotics, microfluidics, tissue engineering, drug delivery, surgery, and biomedical engineering.

AB This paper presents the results of an investigation into several non-linear machine learning and soft computing-based models, namely, feedforward neural network (FFNN), radial basis neural network (RBNN), general regression neural network (GRNN), support vector machine (SVM), tree regression fitting model (TREE) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The data sets are from extensive finite element modelling (FEM) of a shallow strip footing located near a homogeneous sandy slope. The FEM outputs are used for training and testing the models. Furthermore, the predicted and calculated models are compared and evaluated using different statistical indices and the most accurate model is presented as a simple formula. After model evaluation process the most accurate model is proposed to estimate the solution. The predicted results are compared with the FEM data, and a good agreement is obtained representing good reliability for FFNN (R-2 = 0.9233 for training and 0.9095 for testing) solutions in this study. Moreover, the soft computing model is presented as a simple formula and excellent agreement is obtained representing a high degree of reliability for the proposed model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background Atrial fibrillation is frequently asymptomatic and thus underdetected but is associated with stroke, heart failure, and death. Existing screening methods require prolonged monitoring and are limited by cost and low yield. We aimed to develop a rapid, inexpensive, point-of-care means of identifying patients with atrial fibrillation using machine learning. Methods We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiograph (ECG) using a convolutional neural network to detect the electrocardiographic signature of atrial fibrillation present during normal sinus rhythm using standard 10-second, 12-lead ECGs. We included all patients aged 18 years or older with at least one digital, normal sinus rhythm, standard 10-second, 12-lead ECG acquired in the supine position at the Mayo Clinic ECG laboratory between Dec 31, 1993, and July 21, 2017, with rhythm labels validated by trained personnel under cardiologist supervision. We classified patients with at least one ECG with a rhythm of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter as positive for atrial fibrillation. We allocated ECGs to the training, internal validation, and testing datasets in a 7: 1: 2 ratio. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operatoring characteristic curve for the internal validation dataset to select a probability threshold, which we applied to the testing dataset. We evaluated model performance on the testing dataset by calculating the AUC and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score with two-sided 95% CIs. Findings We included 180 922 patients with 649 931 normal sinus rhythm ECGs for analysis: 454 789 ECGs recorded from 126 526 patients in the training dataset, 64 340 ECGs from 18 116 patients in the internal validation dataset, and 130 802 ECGs from 36 280 patients in the testing dataset. 3051 (8.4%) patients in the testing dataset had verified atrial fibrillation before the normal sinus rhythm ECG tested by the model. A single AI-enabled ECG identified atrial fibrillation with an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI 0.86-0.88), sensitivity of 79.0% (77.5-80.4), specificity of 79.5% (79.0-79.9), F1 score of 39.2% (38.1-40.3), and overall accuracy of 79.4% (79.0-79.9). Including all ECGs acquired during the first month of each patient's window of interest (ie, the study start date or 31 days before the first recorded atrial fibrillation ECG) increased the AUC to 0.90 (0.90-0.91), sensitivity to 82.3% (80.9-83.6), specificity to 83.4% (83.0-83.8), F1 score to 45.4% (44.2-46.5), and overall accuracy to 83.3% (83.0-83.7). Interpretation An AI-enabled ECG acquired during normal sinus rhythm permits identification at point of care of individuals with atrial fibrillation. Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper studies the fault-tolerant control (FTC) problem for unknown affine nonlinear systems with actuators faults. The considered types of faults are stuck (lock-in-place), loss-in-effectiveness (LIE), and bias, under which a part of the actuators is disabled. The objective is to find the remaining (not fully LIE) actuators, and manipulate them to obtain the best achievable performance in real time. First, considering that the best achievable performance is determined by the remaining actuators, a set of basic policies is predesigned with multiple levels of performances for different groups of activated actuators. Second, an identifier is designed based on history data to find the remaining actuators and, thus, the suitable predesigned basic policy. Third, to further accommodate the partial LIEs and biases, a compensator works together with the selected basic policy, to build the predesigned performance. In addressing the FTC problem, several techniques are developed: adjustable mechanisms are novelly integrated to deal with the state-dependent nonlinearities in neural network (NN) approximation, disturbances, and mismatch errors; history data are newly applied to estimate the faulty parameters; and a compensator is specially designed to deal with LIEs and biases in different input channels. Also in theory, the convergences of algorithms and the stability of closed-loop systems are proved, by formally giving the invariant sets of the initial state and the NN weights. Unlike the existing FTC methods dealing with LIE and bias based on model information to optimize the tracking error, this result can handle stuck faults without knowing system dynamics and satisfy different levels of performances described by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. Finally, a simulation example of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed FTC scheme.

AB While new technologies can capture high-resolution normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a surrogate for biomass and leaf greenness, it is a challenge to efficiently apply this technology in a large breeding program. Here we validate a high-throughput phenotyping platform to dynamically monitor NDVI during the growing season for the contrasting wheat cultivars and managements. The images were rapidly captured (approximately 1 ha in 10 min) by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) carrying a multi-spectral camera (RedEdge) at low altitude (30-50 m, 2-5 cm(2) pixel size). NDVIs for individual plots were extracted from the reflectance at Red and Near Infrared wavelengths represented in a reconstructed and segmented ortho-mosaic. NDVI measured by UAV and RedEdge camera were strongly correlated with those measured by hand held GreenSeeker (R-2 = 0.85) but were offset with UAV readings about 0.2 units higher and more compressed. The high-throughput phenotyping platform captured the variation of NDVI among cultivars and treatments (i.e. irrigation, nitrogen and sowing). During the growing season, the NDVI approached saturation around flowering time (similar to 0.92), then gradually decreased until maturity (similar to 0.35). Strong correlations were found between image NDVI around flowering time and final yield (R-2 = 0.82). Given that the image NDVI includes signals from background (soil and senescenced leaves), ground cover from a high resolution hand-held camera was used to adjust the NDVI from UAV. This slightly increased the correlation between adjusted NDVI and yield (R-2 = 0.87). The high-throughput phenotyping platform in this study can be used in agronomy, physiology and breeding to explore the complex interaction of genotype, environment and management. Data fusion from ground and aerial sampling improved the accuracy of low resolution data to integrate observations across multiple scales.

AB This study introduces a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network model to forecast the freshwater yield of a stepped solar still and a conventional one. The stepped solar still was equiped by a copper corrugated absorber plate. The thermal performance of the stepped solar still is compared with that of conventional single slope solar still. The heat transfer coefficients of convection, evaporation, and radiation process have been evaluated. The exergy and energy efficiencies of both solar stills have been also evaluated. The yield of the stepped solar still is enhanced by about 128 % compared with that of conventional solar still. Then, the proposed LSTM neural network method is utilized to forecast the hourly yield of the investigated solar stills. Field experimental data was used to train and test the developed model. The freshwater yield was used in a time series form to train the proposed model. The forecasting accuracy of the proposed model was compared with those obtained by conventional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and was evaluated using different statistical assessment measures. The coefficient of determination of the forecasted results has a high value of 0.97 and 0.99 for the conventional and the stepped solar still, respectively.

AB Pedestrian misalignment, which mainly arises from detector errors and pose variations, is a critical problem for a robust person re-identification (re-ID) system. With poor alignment, the feature learning and matching process might be largely compromised. To address this problem, this paper introduces pose-invariant embedding (PIE) as a pedestrian descriptor. First, in order to align pedestrians to a standard pose, the PoseBox structure is introduced, which is generated through pose estimation followed by affine transformations. Second, to reduce the impact of pose estimation errors and information loss during the PoseBox construction, we design a PoseBox fusion (PBF) CNN architecture that takes the original image, the PoseBox, and the pose estimation confidence as input. The proposed PIE descriptor is thus defined as the fully connected layer of the PBF network for the retrieval task. Experiments are conducted on the Market-1501, CUHK03-NP, and DukeMTMC-reID datasets. We show that PoseBox alone yields decent re-ID accuracy and that when integrated in the PBF network, the learned PIE descriptor produces competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

ID PHASE RETRIEVAL
AB We develop a rapidly converging algorithm for stabilizing a large channel-count diffractive optical coherent beam combination. An 81-beam combiner is controlled by a novel, machine-learning based, iterative method to correct the optical phases, operating on an experimentally calibrated numerical model. A neural-network is trained to detect phase errors based on interference pattern recognition of uncombined beams adjacent to the combined one. Due to the non-uniqueness of solutions in the full space of possible phases, the network is trained within a limited phase perturbation/error range. This also reduces the number of samples needed for training. Simulations have proven that the network can converge in one step for small phase perturbations. When the trained neural-network is applied to a realistic case of 360 degree full range, an iterative scheme exploits random walking at the beginning, with the accuracy of prediction on phase feedback direction, to allow the neural-network to step into the training range for fast convergence. This neural-network-based iterative method of phase detection works tens of times faster than the commonly used stochastic parallel gradient descent approach (SPGD) using a single-detector and random dither when both are tested with random phase perturbations.

AB Neural networks were widely used for quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) in the 1990s. Because of various practical issues (e.g., slow on large problems, difficult to train, prone to overfitting, etc.), they were superseded by more robust methods like support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which arose in the early 2000s. The last 10 years has witnessed a revival of neural networks in the machine learning community thanks to new methods for preventing overfitting, more efficient training algorithms, and advancements in computer hardware. In particular, deep neural nets (DNNs), i.e. neural nets with more than one hidden layer, have found great successes in many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Here we show that DNNs can routinely make better prospective predictions than RF on a set of large diverse QSAR data sets that are taken from Mercks drug discovery effort. The number of adjustable parameters needed for DNNs is fairly large, but our results show that it is not necessary to optimize them for individual data sets, and a single set of recommended parameters can achieve better performance than RF for most of the data sets we studied. The usefulness of the parameters is demonstrated on additional data sets not used in the calibration. Although training DNNs is still computationally intensive, using graphical processing units (GPUs) can make this issue manageable.

AB We review the work on data-driven grasp synthesis and the methodologies for sampling and ranking candidate grasps. We divide the approaches into three groups based on whether they synthesize grasps for known, familiar, or unknown objects. This structure allows us to identify common object representations and perceptual processes that facilitate the employed data-driven grasp synthesis technique. In the case of known objects, we concentrate on the approaches that are based on object recognition and pose estimation. In the case of familiar objects, the techniques use some form of a similarity matching to a set of previously encountered objects. Finally, for the approaches dealing with unknown objects, the core part is the extraction of specific features that are indicative of good grasps. Our survey provides an overview of the different methodologies and discusses open problems in the area of robot grasping. We also draw a parallel to the classical approaches that rely on analytic formulations.

TI Building machines that learn and think like people
SO BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Recent progress in artificial intelligence has renewed interest in building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or even beats that of humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Specifically, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.

AB The algorithm of synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) is generally composed of the extraction of a set of features that transform the raw input into a representation, followed by a trainable classifier. The feature extractor is often hand designed with domain knowledge and can significantly impact the classification accuracy. By automatically learning hierarchies of features from massive training data, deep convolutional networks (ConvNets) recently have obtained state-of-the-art results in many computer vision and speech recognition tasks. However, when ConvNets was directly applied to SAR-ATR, it yielded severe overfitting due to limited training images. To reduce the number of free parameters, we present a new all-convolutional networks (A-ConvNets), which only consists of sparsely connected layers, without fully connected layers being used. Experimental results on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) benchmark data set illustrate that A-ConvNets can achieve an average accuracy of 99% on classification of ten-class targets and is significantly superior to the traditional ConvNets on the classification of target configuration and version variants.

AB Electronic nose, electronic tongue and computer vision systems, designed to artificially perceive flavour and appearance, have been increasingly used in the food industry as rapid and reliable tools for quality assessment. The use of multivariate analysis methods, together with electronic senses, has shown to be very powerful; however, due to the high complexity of food, the employment of just single sensor data is often insufficient. In recent years, much research has been performed to develop several data fusion strategies, combining the outputs of multiple instrumental sources, for improving the quality assessment and authentication of food. The aim of this work is to review the recent achievements in the field of artificial sensors' application, in the evaluation of animal source food products. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The development of smart cities and deep learning technology is changing our physical world to a cyber world. As one of the main applications, the Internet of Vehicles has been developing rapidly. However, privacy leakage and delay problem for data collection remain as the key concerns behind the fast development of the cyber intelligence technologies. If the original data collected are directly uploaded to the cloud for processing, it will bring huge load pressure and delay to the network communication. Moreover, during this process, it will lead to the leakage of data privacy. To this end, in this article we design a data collection and preprocessing scheme based on deep learning, which adopts the semisupervised learning algorithm of data augmentation and label guessing. Data filtering is performed at the edge layer, and a large amount of similar data and irrelevant data are cleared. If the edge device cannot process some complex data independently, it will send the processed and reliable data to the cloud for further processing, which maximizes the protection of user privacy. Our method significantly reduces the amount of data uploaded to the cloud, and meanwhile protects the user's data privacy effectively.

AB For an autonomous vehicle to operate safely and effectively, an accurate and robust localization system is essential. While there are a variety of vehicle localization techniques in literature, there is a lack of effort in comparing these techniques and identifying their potentials and limitations for autonomous vehicle applications. Hence, this paper evaluates the state-of-the-art vehicle localization techniques and investigates their applicability on autonomous vehicles. The analysis starts with discussing the techniques which merely use the information obtained from on-board vehicle sensors. It is shown that although some techniques can achieve the accuracy required for autonomous driving but suffer from the high cost of the sensors and also sensor performance limitations in different driving scenarios (e.g., cornering and intersections) and different environmental conditions (e.g., darkness and snow). This paper continues the analysis with considering the techniques which benefit from off-board information obtained from V2X communication channels, in addition to vehicle sensory information. The analysis shows that augmenting off-board information to sensory information has potential to design low-cost localization systems with high accuracy and robustness, however, their performance depends on penetration rate of nearby connected vehicles or infrastructure and the quality of network service.

AB Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has caused many death cases and affected all sectors of human life. With gradual progression of time, COVID-19 was declared by the world health organization (WHO) as an outbreak, which has imposed a heavy burden on almost all countries, especially ones with weaker health systems and ones with slow responses. In the field of healthcare, deep learning has been implemented in many applications, e.g., diabetic retinopathy detection, lung nodule classification, fetal localization, and thyroid diagnosis. Numerous sources of medical images (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI) make deep learning a great technique to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. Motivated by this fact, a large number of research works have been proposed and developed for the initial months of 2020. In this paper, we first focus on summarizing the state-of-the-art research works related to deep learning applications for COVID-19 medical image processing. Then, we provide an overview of deep learning and its applications to healthcare found in the last decade. Next, three use cases in China, Korea, and Canada are also presented to show deep learning applications for COVID-19 medical image processing. Finally, we discuss several challenges and issues related to deep learning implementations for COVID-19 medical image processing, which are expected to drive further studies in controlling the outbreak and controlling the crisis, which results in smart healthy cities.

AB We present a deep neural network-based approach to image quality assessment (IQA). The network is trained end-to-end and comprises ten convolutional layers and five pooling layers for feature extraction, and two fully connected layers for regression, which makes it significantly deeper than related IQA models. Unique features of the proposed architecture are that: 1) with slight adaptations it can be used in a no-reference (NR) as well as in a full-reference (FR) IQA setting and 2) it allows for joint learning of local quality and local weights, i.e., relative importance of local quality to the global quality estimate, in an unified framework. Our approach is purely data-driven and does not rely on hand-crafted features or other types of prior domain knowledge about the human visual system or image statistics. We evaluate the proposed approach on the LIVE, CISQ, and TID2013 databases as well as the LIVE In the wild image quality challenge database and show superior performance to state-of-the-art NR and FR IQA methods. Finally, cross-database evaluation shows a high ability to generalize between different databases, indicating a high robustness of the learned features.

AB Machine learning (ML) encompasses a broad range of algorithms and modeling tools used for a vast array of data processing tasks, which has entered most scientific disciplines in recent years. This article reviews in a selective way the recent research on the interface between machine learning and the physical sciences. This includes conceptual developments in ML motivated by physical insights, applications of machine learning techniques to several domains in physics, and cross fertilization between the two fields. After giving a basic notion of machine learning methods and principles, examples are described of how statistical physics is used to understand methods in ML. This review then describes applications of ML methods in particle physics and cosmology, quantum many-body physics, quantum computing, and chemical and material physics. Research and development into novel computing architectures aimed at accelerating ML are also highlighted. Each of the sections describe recent successes as well as domain-specific methodology and challenges.

AB The medical imaging literature has witnessed remarkable progress in high-performing segmentation models based on convolutional neural networks. Despite the new performance highs, the recent advanced segmentation models still require large, representative, and high quality annotated datasets. However, rarely do we have a perfect training dataset, particularly in the field of medical imaging, where data and annotations are both expensive to acquire. Recently, a large body of research has studied the problem of medical image segmentation with imperfect datasets, tackling two major dataset limitations: scarce annotations where only limited annotated data is available for training, and weak annotations where the training data has only sparse annotations, noisy annotations, or image-level annotations. In this article, we provide a detailed review of the solutions above, summarizing both the technical novelties and empirical results. We further compare the benefits and requirements of the surveyed methodologies and provide our recommended solutions. We hope this survey article increases the community awareness of the techniques that are available to handle imperfect medical image segmentation datasets. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Effective common spatial pattern (CSP) feature extraction for motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings usually depends on the filter band selection to a large extent. Subband optimization has been suggested to enhance classification accuracy of MI. Accordingly, this study introduces a new method that implements sparse Bayesian learning of frequency bands (named SBLFB) from EEG for MI classification. CSP features are extracted on a set of signals that are generated by a filter bank with multiple overlapping subbands from raw EEG data. Sparse Bayesian learning is then exploited to implement selection of significant features with a linear discriminant criterion for classification. The effectiveness of SBLFB is demonstrated on the BCI Competition IV IIb dataset, in comparison with several other competing methods. Experimental results indicate that the SBLFB method is promising for development of an effective classifier to improve MI classification.

LA English
DT Article
ID TEXTURE ANALYSIS; CANCER
AB Purpose: To evaluate ability of radiomic (computer-extracted imaging) features to distinguish non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinomas from granulomas at noncontrast CT.
   Materials and Methods: For this retrospective study, screening or standard diagnostic noncontrast CT images were collected for 290 patients (mean age, 68 years; range, 18-92 years; 125 men [mean age, 67 years; range, 18-90 years] and 165 women [mean age, 68 years; range, 33-92 years]) from two institutions between 2007 and 2013. Histopathologic analysis was available for one nodule per patient. Corresponding nodule of interest was identified on axial CT images by a radiologist with manual annotation. Nodule shape, wavelet (Gabor), and texture-based (Haralick and Laws energy) features were extracted from intra- and perinodular regions. Features were pruned to train machine learning classifiers with 145 patients. In a test set of 145 patients, classifier results were compared against a convolutional neural network (CNN) and diagnostic readings of two radiologists.
   Results: Support vector machine classifier with intranodular radiomic features achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.75 on the test set. Combining radiomics of intranodular with perinodular regions improved the AUC to 0.80. On the same test set, CNN resulted in an AUC of 0.76. Radiologist readers achieved AUCs of 0.61 and 0.60, respectively.
   Conclusion: Radiomic features from intranodular and perinodular regions of nodules can distinguish non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinomas from benign granulomas at noncontrast CT. (C) RSNA, 2018

AB The stock market forecasting is one of the most challenging application of machine learning, as its historical data are naturally noisy and unstable. Most of the successful approaches act in a supervised manner, labeling training data as being of positive or negative moments of the market. However, training machine learning classifiers in such a way may suffer from over-fitting, since the market behavior depends on several external factors like other markets trends, political events, etc. In this paper, we aim at minimizing such problems by proposing an ensemble of reinforcement learning approaches which do not use annotations (i.e. market goes up or down) to learn, but rather learn how to maximize a return function over the training stage. In order to achieve this goal, we exploit a Q-learning agent trained several times with the same training data and investigate its ensemble behavior in important real-world stock markets. Experimental results in intraday trading indicate better performance than the conventional Buy-and-Hold strategy, which still behaves well in our setups. We also discuss qualitative and quantitative analyses of these results.

AB The goal of ensemble regression is to combine several models in order to improve the prediction accuracy in learning problems with a numerical target variable. The process of ensemble learning can be divided into three phases: the generation phase, the pruning phase, and the integration phase. We discuss different approaches to each of these phases that are able to deal with the regression problem, categorizing them in terms of their relevant characteristics and linking them to contributions from different fields. Furthermore, this work makes it possible to identify interesting areas for future research.

AB Policy-gradient-based actor-critic algorithms are amongst the most popular algorithms in the reinforcement learning framework. Their advantage of being able to search for optimal policies using low-variance gradient estimates has made them useful in several real-life applications, such as robotics, power control, and finance. Although general surveys on reinforcement learning techniques already exist, no survey is specifically dedicated to actor-critic algorithms in particular. This paper, therefore, describes the state of the art of actor-critic algorithms, with a focus on methods that can work in an online setting and use function approximation in order to deal with continuous state and action spaces. After starting with a discussion on the concepts of reinforcement learning and the origins of actor-critic algorithms, this paper describes the workings of the natural gradient, which has made its way into many actor-critic algorithms over the past few years. A review of several standard and natural actor-critic algorithms is given, and the paper concludes with an overview of application areas and a discussion on open issues.

AB In this study, we used an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to collect a time series of high-resolution images over four years at seven epochs to assess landslide dynamics. Structure from Motion (SfM) was applied to create Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the landslide surface with an accuracy of 4-5 cm in the horizontal and 3-4 cm in the vertical direction. The accuracy of the co-registration of subsequent DSMs was checked and corrected based on comparing non-active areas of the landslide, which minimized alignment errors to a mean of 0.07 m. Variables such as landslide area and the leading edge slope were measured and temporal patterns were discovered. Volumetric changes of particular areas of the landslide were measured over the time series. Surface movement of the landslide was tracked and quantified with the COSI-Corr image correlation algorithm but without ground validation. Historical aerial photographs were used to create a baseline DSM, and the total displacement of the landslide was found to be approximately 6630 m(3). This study has demonstrated a robust and repeatable algorithm that allows a landslide's dynamics to be mapped and monitored with a UAV over a relatively long time series.

AB The energy performance of buildings was estimated using various data mining techniques, including support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN), classification and regression tree, chi-, squared automatic interaction detector, general linear regression, and ensemble inference model. The prediction models were constructed using 768 experimental datasets from the literature with 8 input parameters and 2 output parameters (cooling load (CL) and heating load (HL)). Comparison results showed that the ensemble approach (SVR +ANN) and SVR were the best models for predicting CL and HL, respectively, with mean absolute percentage errors below 4%. Compared to previous works, the ensemble model and SVR model further obtained at least 39.0% to 65.9% lower root mean square errors, respectively, for CL and HL prediction. This study confirms the efficiency, effectiveness, and accuracy of the proposed approach when predicting CL and HL in building design stage. The analytical results support the feasibility of using the proposed techniques to facilitate early designs of energy conserving buildings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the past decade, advances in precision oncology have resulted in an increased demand for predictive assays that enable the selection and stratification of patients for treatment. The enormous divergence of signalling and transcriptional networks mediating the crosstalk between cancer, stromal and immune cells complicates the development of functionally relevant biomarkers based on a single gene or protein. However, the result of these complex processes can be uniquely captured in the morphometric features of stained tissue specimens. The possibility of digitizing whole-slide images of tissue has led to the advent of artificial intelligence (Al) and machine learning tools in digital pathology, which enable mining of subvisual morphometric phenotypes and might, ultimately, improve patient management. In this Perspective, we critically evaluate various AI-based computational approaches for digital pathology, focusing on deep neural networks and 'hand-crafted' feature-based methodologies. We aim to provide a broad framework for incorporating Al and machine learning tools into clinical oncology, with an emphasis on biomarker development. We discuss some of the challenges relating to the use of Al, including the need for well-curated validation datasets, regulatory approval and fair reimbursement strategies. Finally, we present potential future opportunities for precision oncology.

Herein, the authors explain key methodology points involved in a clinical evaluation of artificial intelligence technology for use in medicine, especially high-dimensional or overparameterized diagnostic or predictive models in which artificial deep neural networks are used, mainly from the standpoints of clinical epidemiology and biostatistics. First, statistical methods for assessing the discrimination and calibration performances of a diagnostic or predictive model are summarized. Next, the effects of disease manifestation spectrum and disease prevalence on the performance results are explained, followed by a discussion of the difference between evaluating the performance with use of internal and external datasets, the importance of using an adequate external dataset obtained from a well-defined clinical cohort to avoid overestimating the clinical performance as a result of overfitting in high-dimensional or overparameterized classification model and spectrum bias, and the essentials for achieving a more robust clinical evaluation. Finally, the authors review the role of clinical trials and observational outcome studies for ultimate clinical verification of diagnostic or predictive artificial intelligence tools through patient outcomes, beyond performance metrics, and how to design such studies.

ID DESCRIPTOR
AB This letter presents an effective method to encode the spatiotemporal information of a skeleton sequence into color texture images, referred to as skeleton optical spectra, and employs convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) to learn the discriminative features for action recognition. Such spectrum representation makes it possible to use a standard ConvNet architecture to learn suitable "dynamic" features from skeleton sequences without training millions of parameters afresh and it is especially valuable when there is insufficient annotated training video data. Specifically, the encoding consists of four steps: mapping of joint distribution, spectrum coding of joint trajectories, spectrum coding of body parts, and joint velocity weighted saturation and brightness. Experimental results on three widely used datasets have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed method.

AB The massive growth of data that are transmitted through a variety of devices and communication protocols have raised serious security concerns, which have increased the importance of developing advanced intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Deep learning is an advanced branch of machine learning, composed of multiple layers of neurons that represent the learning process. Deep learning can cope with large-scale data and has shown success in different fields. Therefore, researchers have paid more attention to investigating deep learning for intrusion detection. This survey comprehensively reviews and compares the key previous deep learning-focused cybersecurity surveys. Through an extensive review, this survey provides a novel fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes the current state-of-the-art deep learning-based IDSs with respect to different facets, including input data, detection, deployment, and evaluation strategies. Each facet is further classified according to different criteria. This survey also compares and discusses the related experimental solutions proposed as deep learning-based IDSs.
   By analysing the experimental studies, this survey discusses the role of deep learning in intrusion detection, the impact of intrusion detection datasets, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The findings demonstrate that further effort is required to improve the current state-of-the art. Finally, open research challenges are identified, and future research directions for deep learning-based IDSs are recommended. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quantum information technologies, on the one hand, and intelligent learning systems, on the other, are both emergent technologies that are likely to have a transformative impact on our society in the future. The respective underlying fields of basic research-quantum information versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question of the extent to which these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. Quantum ML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for ML problems, critical in our ` big data' world. Conversely, ML already permeates many cutting-edge technologies and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement-exploring what ML/AI can do for quantum physics and vice versaresearchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating ML and AI in the quantum domain.

ID ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; NEURAL-NETWORK; LAMSTAR; SYSTEM
AB Bearing is one of the most critical components inmost electrical and power drives. Effective bearing fault diagnosis is important for keeping the electrical and power drives safe and operating normally. In the age of Internet of Things and Industrial 4.0, massive real-time data are collected from bearing health monitoring systems. Mechanical big data have the characteristics of large volume, diversity, and high velocity. There are two major problems in using the existing methods for bearing fault diagnosis with big data. The features are manually extracted relying on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise, and the used models have shallow architectures, limiting their capability in fault diagnosis. Effectively mining features from big data and accurately identifying the bearing health conditions with new advanced methods have become new issues. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for bearing fault diagnosis. The presented approach preprocesses sensor signals using short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Based on a simple spectrum matrix obtained by STFT, an optimized deep learning structure, large memory storage retrieval (LAMSTAR) neural network, is built to diagnose the bearing faults. Acoustic emission signals acquired from a bearing test rig are used to validate the presented method. The validation results show the accurate classification performance on various bearing faults under different working conditions. The performance of the presented method is also compared with other effective bearing fault diagnosis methods reported in the literature. The comparison results have shown that the presented method gives much better diagnostic performance, even at relatively low rotating speeds.

AB This research proposes and evaluates a new approach for flash flood susceptibility mapping based on Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN)) algorithm, with a case study at a high-frequency tropical storm area in the northwest mountainous region of Vietnam. Accordingly, a DLNN structure with 192 neurons in 3 hidden layers was proposed to construct an inference model that predicts different levels of susceptibility to flash flood. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and the sigmoid were selected as the activate function and the transfer function, respectively, whereas the Adaptive moment estimation (Adam) was used to update and optimize the weights of the DLNN. A database for the study area, which includes factors of elevation, slope, curvature, aspect, stream density, NDVI, soil type, lithology, and rainfall, was established to train and validate the proposed model. Feature selection was carried out for these factors using the Information gain ratio. The results show that the DLNN attains a good prediction accuracy with Classification Accuracy Rate = 92.05%, Positive Predictive Value = 94.55% and Negative Predictive Value = 89.55%. Compared to benchmarks, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and Support Vector Machine, the DLNN performs better; therefore, it could be concluded that the proposed hybridization of GIS and deep learning can be a promising tool to assist the government authorities and involving parties in flash flood mitigation and land-use planning.

AB Object detection is a fundamental step for automated video analysis in many vision applications. Object detection in a video is usually. performed by object detectors or background subtraction techniques. Often, an object detector requires Manually labeled examples to train a binary classifier, while background subtraction needs a training sequence that contains no objects to build a background model. To automate the analysis, object detection without a separate training phase becomes a critical task. People have tried to tackle this task by using motion information. But existing motion-based Methods are usually limited when coping with complex scenarios such as nonrigid motion and dynamic background. In this paper, we show that the above challenges can be addressed in a unified framework named, DEtecting Contiguous Outliers in the LOw-rank Representation (DECOLOR). This formulation integrates object detection and background learning into a single process of optimization, which can be solved by an alternating algorithm efficiently. We explain the relations between DECOLOR and other sparsity-based methods. Experiments on both simulated data and real sequences demonstrate that DECOLOR outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and it can work effectively on a wide range of complex scenarios.

AB Machine learning is a technique for recognizing patterns that can be applied to medical images. Although it is a powerful tool that can help in rendering medical diagnoses, it can be misapplied. Machine learning typically begins with the machine learning algorithm system computing the image features that are believed to be of importance in making the prediction or diagnosis of interest. The machine learning algorithm system then identifies the best combination of these image features for classifying the image or computing some metric for the given image region. There are several methods that can be used, each with different strengths and weaknesses. There are open-source versions of most of these machine learning methods that make them easy to try and apply to images. Several metrics for measuring the performance of an algorithm exist; however, one must be aware of the possible associated pitfalls that can result in misleading metrics. More recently, deep learning has started to be used; this method has the benefit that it does not require image feature identification and calculation as a first step; rather, features are identified as part of the learning process. Machine learning has been used in medical imaging and will have a greater influence in the future. Those working in medical imaging must be aware of how machine learning works.

AB Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry applied to photographs captured from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms is increasingly being utilised for a wide range of applications including structural characterisation of forests. The aim of this study was to undertake a first evaluation of whether SfM from UAVs has potential as a low cost method for forest monitoring within developing countries in the context of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). The project evaluated SfM horizontal and vertical accuracy for measuring the height of individual trees. Aerial image data were collected for two test sites; Meshaw (Devon, UK) and Dryden (Scotland, UK) using a Quest QPOD fixed wing UAV and DJI Phantom 2 quadcopter UAV, respectively. Comparisons were made between SfM and airborne LiDAR point clouds and surface models at the Meshaw site, while at Dryden, SfM tree heights were compared to ground measured tree heights. Results obtained showed a strong correlation between SfM and LiDAR digital surface models (R2 = 0.89) and canopy height models (R2 = 0.75). However, at Dryden, a poor correlation was observed between SfM tree heights and ground measured heights (R2 = 0.19). The poor results at Dryden were explained by the fact that the forest plot had a closed canopy structure such that SfM failed to generate enough below-canopy ground points. Finally, an evaluation of UAV surveying methods was also undertaken to determine their usefulness and cost-effectiveness for plot-level forest monitoring. The study concluded that although SfM from UAVs performs poorly in closed canopies, it can still provide a low cost solution in those developing countries where forests have sparse canopy cover (< 50%) with individual tree crowns and ground surfaces well-captured by SfM photogrammetry. Since more than half of the forest covered areas of the world have canopy cover < 50%, we can conclude that SfM has enormous potential for forest mapping in developing countries.

AB Technology-based self-help and minimal contact therapies have been proposed as effective and low-cost interventions for anxiety and mood disorders. The present article reviews the literature published before 2010 on these treatments for anxiety and depression using self-help and decreased therapist-contact interventions. Treatment studies are examined by disorder as well as amount of therapist contact, ranging from self-administered therapy and predominantly self-help interventions to minimal contact therapy where the therapist is actively involved in treatment but to a lesser degree than traditional therapy and predominantly therapist-administered treatments involving regular contact with a therapist for a typical number of sessions. In the treatment of anxiety disorders, it is concluded that self-administered and predominantly self-help interventions are most effective for motivated clients. Conversely, minimal-contact therapies have demonstrated efficacy for the greatest variety of anxiety diagnoses when accounting for both attrition and compliance. Additionally, predominantly self-help computer-based cognitive and behavioral interventions are efficacious in the treatment of subthreshold mood disorders. However, therapist-assisted treatments remain optimal in the treatment of clinical levels of depression. Although the most efficacious amount of therapist contact varies by disorder, computerized treatments have been shown to be a less-intensive, cost-effective way to deliver empirically validated treatments for a variety of psychological problems.

DE sentiment analysis; benchmark; methods evaluation
ID EMOTIONS; NORMS
AB In the last few years thousands of scientific papers have investigated sentiment analysis, several startups that measure opinions on real data have emerged and a number of innovative products related to this theme have been developed. There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity of some methods, it is unclear which one is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message. Accordingly, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough apple-to-apple comparison of sentiment analysis methods, as they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated from different data sources. Such a comparison is key for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods. This article aims at filling this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty-four popular sentiment analysis methods (which we call the state-of-the-practice methods). Our evaluation is based on a benchmark of eighteen labeled datasets, covering messages posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as well as opinions and comments in news articles. Our results highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of these methods varies considerably across datasets. Aiming at boosting the development of this research area, we open the methods' codes and datasets used in this article, deploying them in a benchmark system, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing sentence-level sentiment analysis methods.

TI MACHINE LEARNING PARADIGMS FOR NEXT-GENERATION WIRELESS NETWORKS
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Next-generation wireless networks are expected to support extremely high data rates and radically new applications, which require a new wireless radio technology paradigm. The challenge is that of assisting the radio in intelligent adaptive learning and decision making, so that the diverse requirements of next-generation wireless networks can be satisfied. Machine learning is one of the most promising artificial intelligence tools, conceived to support smart radio terminals. Future smart 5G mobile terminals are expected to autonomously access the most meritorious spectral bands with the aid of sophisticated spectral efficiency learning and inference, in order to control the transmission power, while relying on energy efficiency learning/inference and simultaneously adjusting the transmission protocols with the aid of quality of service learning/inference. Hence we briefly review the rudimentary concepts of machine learning and propose their employment in the compelling applications of 5G networks, including cognitive radios, massive MIMOs, femto/small cells, heterogeneous networks, smart grid, energy harvesting, device-to-device communications, and so on. Our goal is to assist the readers in refining the motivation, problem formulation, and methodology of powerful machine learning algorithms in the context of future networks in order to tap into hitherto unexplored applications and services.

AB Air pollution is one of the serious environmental problems that humankind faces and also a hot topic in Northeastern Asia. Therefore, the accurate prediction of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <= 2.5 mu m) is very significant in the management of human health and the decision-making of government for the environmental management. In this study, a spatiotemporal convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term (LSTM) memory (CNN-LSTM) model (also called PM (particulate matter) predictor) was proposed and used to predict the next day's daily average PM2.5 concentration in Beijing City. The spatiotemporal correlation analysis using the mutual information (MI) was performed, considering not only the linear correlation but also nonlinear correlation between target and observation parameters; in addition, it was fully considered for the whole area of China with the target monitoring station as the center and also for the historic air quality and meteorological data. As a result, the spatiotemporal feature vector (STFV) which reflects both linear and nonlinear correlations between parameters was effectively constructed. The PM predictor secured a fast and accurate prediction performance by efficiently extracting the inherent features of the latent air quality and meteorological input data associated with PM2.5 through CNN and by fully reflecting the long-term historic process of input time series data through LSTM. The air quality and meteorological data from the 384 monitoring stations which represents the whole area of China with Beijing City as the center during the 3 years (Jan. 1st, 2015 to Dec. 31th, 2017) were used to verify the validity of the proposed method. In conclusion, the proposed method was proved to have a better stability and prediction performance compared to multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and LSTM models. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Brain extraction from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many neuroimaging workflows. Current methods demonstrate good results on non-enhanced T1-weighted images, but struggle when confronted with other modalities and pathologically altered tissue. In this paper we present a 3D convolutional deep learning architecture to address these shortcomings. In contrast to existing methods, we are not limited to non-enhanced T1w images. When trained appropriately, our approach handles an arbitrary number of modalities including contrast-enhanced scans. Its applicability to MRI data, comprising four channels: non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced T1w, T2w and FLAIR contrasts, is demonstrated on a challenging clinical data set containing brain tumors (N = 53), where our approach significantly outperforms six commonly used tools with a mean Dice score of 95.19. Further, the proposed method at least matches state-of-the-art performance as demonstrated on three publicly available data sets: IBSR, LPBA40 and OASIS, totaling N=135 volumes. For the IBSR (96.32) and LPBA40 (96.96) data set the convolutional neuronal network (CNN) obtains the highest average Dice scores, albeit not being significantly different from the second best performing method. For the OASIS data the second best Dice (95.02) results are achieved, with no statistical difference in comparison to the best performing tool. For all data sets the highest average specificity measures are evaluated, whereas the sensitivity displays about average results. Adjusting the cut-off threshold for generating the binary masks from the CNN's probability output can be used to increase the sensitivity of the method. Of course, this comes at the cost of a decreased specificity and has to be decided application specific. Using an optimized GPU implementation predictions can be achieved in less than one minute. The proposed method may prove useful for large-scale studies and clinical trials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Fluorescence microscopy is a key driver of discoveries in the life sciences, with observable phenomena being limited by the optics of the microscope, the chemistry of the fluorophores, and the maximum photon exposure tolerated by the sample. These limits necessitate trade-offs between imaging speed, spatial resolution, light exposure, and imaging depth. In this work we show how content-aware image restoration based on deep learning extends the range of biological phenomena observable by microscopy. We demonstrate on eight concrete examples how microscopy images can be restored even if 60-fold fewer photons are used during acquisition, how near isotropic resolution can be achieved with up to tenfold under-sampling along the axial direction, and how tubular and granular structures smaller than the diffraction limit can be resolved at 20-times-higher frame rates compared to state-of-the-art methods. All developed image restoration methods are freely available as open source software in Python, FIJI, and KNIME.

AB Time-varying formation tracking analysis and design problems for second-order Multi-Agent systems with switching interaction topologies are studied, where the states of the followers form a predefined time-varying formation while tracking the state of the leader. A formation tracking protocol is constructed based on the relative information of the neighboring agents. Necessary and sufficient conditions for Multi-Agent systems with switching interaction topologies to achieve time-varying formation tracking are proposed together with the formation tracking feasibility constraint based on the graph theory. An approach to design the formation tracking protocol is proposed by solving an algebraic Riccati equation, and the stability of the proposed approach is proved using the common Lyapunov stability theory. The obtained results are applied to solve the target enclosing problem of amultiquadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system consisting of one leader (target) quadrotor UAV and three follower quadrotor UAVs. A numerical simulation and an outdoor experiment are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB Detecting accidents is of great importance since they often impose significant delay and inconvenience to road users. This study compares the performance of two popular machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), to detect the occurrence of accidents on the Eisenhower expressway in Chicago. Accordingly, since the detection of accidents should be as rapid as possible, seven models are trained and tested for each machine learning technique, using traffic condition data from 1 to 7 min after the actual occurrence. The main sources of data used in this study consist of weather condition, accident, and loop detector data. Furthermore, to overcome the problem of imbalanced data (i.e., underrepresentation of accidents in the dataset), the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) is used. The results show that although SVM achieves overall higher accuracy, PNN outperforms SVM regarding the Detection Rate (DR) (i.e., percentage of correct accident detections). In addition, while both models perform best at 5 min after the occurrence of accidents, models trained at 3 or 4 min after the occurrence of an accident detect accidents more rapidly while performing reasonably well. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis of PNN for Time-To-Detection (TM) reveals that the speed difference between upstream and downstream of accidents location is particularly significant to detect the occurrence of accidents.

AB Accurate quantification of uptake on PET images depends on accurate attenuation correction in reconstruction. Current MR-based attenuation correction methods for body PET use a fat and water map derived from a 2-echo Dixon MRI sequence in which bone is neglected. Ultrashort-echo-time or zero-echo-time (ZTE) pulse sequences can capture bone information. We propose the use of patient-specific multiparametric MRI consisting of Dixon MRI and proton-density-weighted ZTE MRI to directly synthesize pseudo-CT images with a deep learning model: we call this method ZTE and Dixon deep pseudo-CT (ZeDD CT). Methods: Twenty-six patients were scanned using an integrated 3-T time-of-flight PET/MRI system. Helical CT images of the patients were acquired separately. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to transform ZTE and Dixon MR images into pseudo-CT images. Ten patients were used for model training, and 16 patients were used for evaluation. Bone and soft-tissue lesions were identified, and the SUVmax was measured. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) was used to compare the MR-based attenuation correction with the ground-truth CT attenuation correction. Results: In total, 30 bone lesions and 60 soft-tissue lesions were evaluated. The RMSE in PET quantification was reduced by a factor of 4 for bone lesions (10.24% for Dixon PET and 2.68% for ZeDD PET) and by a factor of 1.5 for soft-tissue lesions (6.24% for Dixon PET and 4.07% for ZeDD PET). Conclusion: ZeDD CT produces natural-looking and quantitatively accurate pseudo-CT images and reduces error in pelvic PET/MRI attenuation correction compared with standard methods.

AB We present a novel approach to real-time dense visual simultaneous localisation and mapping. Our system is capable of capturing comprehensive dense globally consistent surfel-based maps of room scale environments and beyond explored using an RGB-D camera in an incremental online fashion, without pose graph optimization or any post-processing steps. This is accomplished by using dense frame-to-model camera tracking and windowed surfel-based fusion coupled with frequent model refinement through non-rigid surface deformations. Our approach applies local model-to-model surface loop closure optimizations as often as possible to stay close to the mode of the map distribution, while utilizing global loop closure to recover from arbitrary drift and maintain global consistency. In the spirit of improving map quality as well as tracking accuracy and robustness, we furthermore explore a novel approach to real-time discrete light source detection. This technique is capable of detecting numerous light sources in indoor environments in real-time as a user handheld camera explores the scene. Absolutely no prior information about the scene or number of light sources is required. By making a small set of simple assumptions about the appearance properties of the scene our method can incrementally estimate both the quantity and location of multiple light sources in the environment in an online fashion. Our results demonstrate that our technique functions well in many different environments and lighting configurations. We show that this enables (a) more realistic augmented reality rendering; (b) a richer understanding of the scene beyond pure geometry and; (c) more accurate and robust photometric tracking.

DE Facial aesthetic; aesthetic concept; bio-inspired attention; deep

AB Computational prediction of facial aesthetics has attracted ever-increasing research focus, which has wide range of prospects in multimedia applications. The key challenge lies in extracting discriminative and perception-aware features to characterize the facial beautifulness. To this end, the existing schemes simply adopt a direct feature mapping, which relies on handcraft-designed low-level features that cannot reflect human-level aesthetic perception. In this paper, we present a systematic framework towards designing biology-inspired, discriminative representation for facial aesthetic prediction. First, we design a group of biological experiments that adopt eye tracker to identify spatial regions of interest during the facial aesthetic judgments of subjects, which forms a Bio-inspired Facial Aesthetic Ontology (Bio-FAO) and is made public available. Second, we adopt the cutting-edge convolutional neural network to train a set of Bio-inspired Attribute features, termed Bio-AttriBank, which forms a mid-level interpretable representation corresponding to the aforementioned Bio-FAO. For a given image, the facial aesthetic prediction is then formulated as a classification problem over the Bio-AttriBank descriptor responses, which well bridges the affective gap, and provides explainable evidences on why/how a face is beautiful or not. We have carried out extensive experiments on both JAFFE and FaceWarehouse datasets, with comparisons to a set of state-of-the-art and alternative approaches. Superior performance gains in the experiments have demonstrated the merits of the proposed scheme.

AB Multi-atlas segmentation (MAS), first introduced and popularized by the pioneering work of Rohlfing, et al. (2004), Klein, et al. (2005), and Heckemann, et al. (2006), is becoming one of the most widely-used and successful image segmentation techniques in biomedical applications. By manipulating and utilizing the entire dataset of "atlases" (training images that have been previously labeled, e.g., manually by an expert), rather than some model-based average representation, MAS has the flexibility to better capture anatomical variation, thus offering superior segmentation accuracy. This benefit, however, typically comes at a high computational cost. Recent advancements in computer hardware and image processing software have been instrumental in addressing this challenge and facilitated the wide adoption of MAS. Today, MAS has come a long way and the approach includes a wide array of sophisticated algorithms that employ ideas from machine learning, probabilistic modeling, optimization, and computer vision, among other fields. This paper presents a survey of published MAS algorithms and studies that have applied these methods to various biomedical problems. In writing this survey, we have three distinct aims. Our primary goal is to document how MAS was originally conceived, later evolved, and now relates to alternative methods. Second, this paper is intended to be a detailed reference of past research activity in MAS, which now spans over a decade (2003-2014) and entails novel methodological developments and application-specific solutions. Finally, our goal is to also present a perspective on the future of MAS, which, we believe, will be one of the dominant approaches in biomedical image segmentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB The increasing demands on information processing require novel computational concepts and true parallelism. Nevertheless, hardware realizations of unconventional computing approaches never exceeded a marginal existence. While the application of optics in supercomputing receives reawakened interest, new concepts, partly neuro-inspired, are being considered and developed. Here we experimentally demonstrate the potential of a simple photonic architecture to process information at unprecedented data rates, implementing a learning-based approach. A semiconductor laser subject to delayed self-feedback and optical data injection is employed to solve computationally hard tasks. We demonstrate simultaneous spoken digit and speaker recognition and chaotic time-series prediction at data rates beyond 1 Gbyte/s. We identify all digits with very low classification errors and perform chaotic time-series prediction with 10% error. Our approach bridges the areas of photonic information processing, cognitive and information science.

TI Using deep learning for digital soil mapping
SO SOIL
LA English
DT Article
ID ORGANIC-CARBON; PREDICTION; REGION
AB Digital soil mapping (DSM) has been widely used as a cost-effective method for generating soil maps. However, current DSM data representation rarely incorporates contextual information of the landscape. DSM models are usually calibrated using point observations intersected with spatially corresponding point covariates. Here, we demonstrate the use of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model that incorporates contextual information surrounding an observation to significantly improve the prediction accuracy over conventional DSM models. We describe a CNN model that takes inputs as images of covariates and explores spatial contextual information by finding non-linear local spatial relationships of neighbouring pixels. Unique features of the proposed model include input represented as a 3-D stack of images, data augmentation to reduce overfitting, and the simultaneous prediction of multiple outputs. Using a soil mapping example in Chile, the CNN model was trained to simultaneously predict soil organic carbon at multiples depths across the country. The results showed that, in this study, the CNN model reduced the error by 30 % compared with conventional techniques that only used point information of covariates. In the example of country-wide mapping at 100 m resolution, the neighbourhood size from 3 to 9 pixels is more effective than at a point location and larger neighbourhood sizes. In addition, the CNN model produces less prediction uncertainty and it is able to predict soil carbon at deeper soil layers more accurately. Because the CNN model takes the covariate represented as images, it offers a simple and effective framework for future DSM models.

ID RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; DECOMPOSITION
AB In most current intelligent diagnosis methods, fault classifiers of electric machine are built based on complex handcrafted features extractor from raw signals, which depend on prior knowledge and is difficult to implement intelligentization authentically. In addition, the increasingly complicated industrial structures and data make handcrafted features extractors less suited. Convolutional neural network (CNN) provides an efficient method to act on raw signals directly by weight sharing and local connections without feature extractors. However, effective as CNN works on image recognition, it does not work well in industrial applications due to the differences between image and industrial signals. Inspired by the idea of CNN, we develop a novel diagnosis framework based on the characteristics of industrial vibration signals, which is called dislocated time series CNN (DTS-CNN). The DTS-CNN architecture is composed of dislocate layer, convolutional layer, sub-sampling layer and fully connected layer. By adding a dislocate layer, this model can extract the relationship between signals with different intervals in periodic mechanical signals, thereby overcome the weaknesses of traditional CNNs and is more applicable for modern electric machines, especially under nonstationary conditions. Experiments under constant and nonstationary conditions are performed on a machine fault simulator to validate the proposed framework. The results and comparison with respect to the state of the art in the field is illustrated in detail, which highlights the superiority of the proposed method in industrial applications.

AB Facial expression recognition is an important research issue in the pattern recognition field. In this paper, we intend to present a novel framework for facial expression recognition to automatically distinguish the expressions with high accuracy. Especially, a high-dimensional feature composed by the combination of the facial geometric and appearance features is introduced to the facial expression recognition due to its containing the accurate and comprehensive information of emotions. Furthermore, the deep sparse autoencoders (DSAE) are established to recognize the facial expressions with high accuracy by learning robust and discriminative features from the data. The experiment results indicate that the presented framework can achieve a high recognition accuracy of 95.79% on the extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database for seven facial expressions, which outperforms the other three state-of-the-art methods by as much as 3.17%, 4.09% and 7.41%, respectively. In particular, the presented approach is also applied to recognize eight facial expressions (including the neutral) and it provides a satisfactory recognition accuracy, which successfully demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach in this paper.

AB The capability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spectral imagery to assess maize yield under full and deficit irrigation is demonstrated by a Tetracam MiniMCA12 11 bands camera. The MiniMCA12 was used to image an experimental field of 19 maize hybrids. Yield prediction models were explored for different maize development stages, with the best model found using maize plant development stage reproductive 2 (R2) for both maize grain yield and ear weight (respective R-2 values of 0.73 and 0.49, and root mean square error of validation (RMSEV) values of 2.07 and 3.41 metric tons per hectare using partial least squares regression (PLS-R) validation models). Models using vegetation indices for inputs rather than superspectral data showed similar R-2 but higher RMSEV values, and produced best results for the R4 development stage. In addition to being able to predict yield, spectral models were able to distinguish between different development stages and irrigation treatments. These abilities potentially allow for yield prediction of maize plants whose development stage and water status are unknown.

In this article, I compare the classification performance of four non-parametric algorithms: support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and deep learning (DL). The study area chosen is a complex mixed-use landscape in south-central Sweden with eight land-cover and land-use (LCLU) classes. The satellite imagery used for the classification were multi-temporal scenes from Sentinel-2 covering spring, summer, autumn and winter conditions. Using stratified random sampling, each LCLU class was allocated 1477 samples, which were divided into training (70%) and evaluation (30%) subsets. Accuracy was assessed through metrics derived from an error matrix, but primarily overall accuracy was used in allocating algorithm hierarchy. A two-proportion Z-test was used to compare the proportions of correctly classified pixels of the algorithms and a McNemar's chi-square test was used to compare class-wise predictions. The results show that the highest overall accuracy was produced by support vector machines (0.758 +/- 0.017), closely followed by extreme gradient boosting (0.751 +/- 0.017), random forests (0.739 +/- 0.018), and finally deep learning (0.733 +/- 0.0023). The Z-test comparison of classifiers showed that a third of algorithm pairings were statistically different. On a class-wise basis, McNemar's test results showed that 62% of class-wise predictions were significant from one another at the 5% level or less. Variable importance metrics show that nearly half of the top twenty Sentinel-2 bands belonged to the red edge (25%) and shortwave infrared (23%) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and were dominated by scenes from spring (38%) and summer (40%). The results are discussed within the scope of recent studies involving machine learning and Sentinel-2 data and key knowledge gaps identified. The article concludes with recommendations for future research.

AB Ground vehicles equipped with monocular vision systems are a valuable source of high-resolution image data for precision agriculture applications in orchards. This paper presents an image processing framework for fruit detection and counting using orchard image data. A general-purpose image segmentation approach is used, including two feature learning algorithms; multiscale multilayered perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). These networks were extended by including contextual information about how the image data was captured (metadata), which correlates with some of the appearance variations and/or class distributions observed in the data. The pixel-wise fruit segmentation output is processed using the watershed segmentation (WS) and circular Hough transform (CHT) algorithms to detect and count individual fruits. Experiments were conducted in a commercial apple orchard near Melbourne, Australia. The results show an improvement in fruit segmentation performance with the inclusion of metadata on the previously benchmarked MLP network. We extend this work with CNNs, bringing agrovision closer to the state-of-the-art in computer vision, where although metadata had negligible influence, the best pixel-wise F1-score of 0.791 was achieved. The WS algorithm produced the best apple detection and counting results, with a detection F1-score of 0.861. As a final step, image fruit counts were accumulated over multiple rows at the orchard and compared against the post-harvest fruit counts that were obtained from a grading and counting machine. The count estimates using CNN and WS resulted in the best performance for this data set, with a squared correlation coefficient of r(2) = 0.826. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Musicians can perform at different tempos, speakers can control the cadence of their speech, and children can flexibly vary their temporal expectations of events. To understand the neural basis of such flexibility, we recorded from the medial frontal cortex of nonhuman primates trained to produce different time intervals with different effectors. Neural responses were heterogeneous, nonlinear, and complex, and they exhibited a remarkable form of temporal invariance: firing rate profiles were temporally scaled to match the produced intervals. Recording from downstream neurons in the caudate and from thalamic neurons projecting to the medial frontal cortex indicated that this phenomenon originates within cortical networks. Recurrent neural network models trained to perform the task revealed that temporal scaling emerges from nonlinearities in the network and that the degree of scaling is controlled by the strength of external input. These findings demonstrate a simple and general mechanism for conferring temporal flexibility upon sensorimotor and cognitive functions.

AB Image segmentation plays an important role in the computer vision . However, it is extremely challenging due to low resolution, high noise and blurry boundaries. Recently, region-based models have been widely used to segment such images. The existing models often utilized Gaussian filtering to filter images, which caused the loss of edge gradient information. Accordingly, in this paper, a novel local region model based on adaptive bilateral filter is presented for segmenting noisy images. Specifically, we firstly construct a range-based adaptive bilateral filter, in which an image can well be preserved edge structures as well as resisted noise. Secondly, we present a data-driven energy model, which utilizes local information of regions centered at each pixel of image to approximate intensities inside and outside of the circular contour. The estimation approach has improved the accuracy of noisy image segmentation. Thirdly, under the premise of keeping the image original shape, a regularization function is used to accelerate the convergence speed and smoothen the segmentation contour. Experimental results of both synthetic and real images demonstrate that the proposed model is more efficient and robust to noise than the state-of-art region-based models.

AB Accurate wind speed prediction plays a vital role in power system in terms of rational dispatching and safe operation. For this purpose, a novel composite framework integrating time varying filter-based empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD), fuzzy entropy (FE) theory, singular spectrum analysis (SSA), phase space reconstruction (PSR), compound prediction models adopting kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM) and convolutional long short-term memory network (ConvLSTM) as well as mutation and hierarchy-based hybrid optimization algorithm, is proposed in this paper. Among the supplementary strategies, TVF-EMD, FE and SSA are employed to achieve non-stationary raw series attenuation, aggregation for approximate IMFs as well as separation of dominant and residuary ingredients from the aggregated IMFs, respectively. Besides, parameters of PSR and KELM as well as wrapper method-based feature selection (FS) for input combination are synchronously optimized by the newly developed swarm optimizer integrating Harris hawks optimization (HHO) and grey wolf optimizer (GWO) with mutation operator and hierarchy strategy. Meanwhile, such hybrid structure is adopted to predict the preprocessed high-frequency components, while the remaining component is predicted by ConvLSTM cells-based deep learning network. Subsequently, the ultimate forecasting results of the raw wind speed are calculated by superimposing the predicted values of all components. Four datasets collected from various sites with two different time intervals and nine relevant contrastive models are carried out to evaluate the proposed approach, where the corresponding results demonstrate that: (1) data preprocessing strategy applying TVF-EMD and FE theory can significantly reduce the time consumption of the entire model without decreasing forecasting performance; (2) SSA-based dominant ingredients extraction can further improve the forecasting capability of combined model; (3) the proposed MHHOGWO can synchronously accomplish parameters optimization and FS effectively, thus improving the forecasting effectiveness of the entire model significantly; (4) the proposed compound prediction models based on KELM and ConvLSTM can exert the capabilities of each model adequately as well as ulteriorly reducing computational requirements.

AB Reliable, automatic, multifunctional, and high-throughput phenotypic technologies are increasingly considered important tools for rapid advancement of genetic gain in breeding programs. With the rapid development in high-throughput phenotyping technologies, research in this area is entering a new era called 'phenomics.' The crop phenotyping community not only needs to build a multi-domain, multi-level, and multi-scale crop phenotyping big database, but also to research technical systems for phenotypic traits identification and develop bioinformatics technologies for information extraction from the overwhelming amounts of omics data. Here, we provide an overview of crop phenomics research, focusing on two parts, from phenotypic data collection through various sensors to phenomics analysis. Finally, we discussed the challenges and prospective of crop phenomics in order to provide suggestions to develop new methods of mining genes associated with important agronomic traits, and propose new intelligent solutions for precision breeding.

AB In these years, the number of biomedical articles has increased exponentially, which becomes a problem for biologists to capture all the needed information manually. Information retrieval technologies, as the core of search engines, can deal with the problem automatically, providing users with the needed information. However, it is a great challenge to apply these technologies directly for biomedical retrieval, because of the abundance of domain specific terminologies. To enhance biomedical retrieval, we propose a novel framework based on learning to rank. Learning to rank is a series of state-of-the-art information retrieval techniques, and has been proved effective in many information retrieval tasks. In the proposed framework, we attempt to tackle the problem of the abundance of terminologies by constructing ranking models, which focus on not only retrieving the most relevant documents, but also diversifying the searching results to increase the completeness of the resulting list for a given query. In the model training, we propose two novel document labeling strategies, and combine several traditional retrieval models as learning features. Besides, we also investigate the usefulness of different learning to rank approaches in our framework. Experimental results on TREC Genomics datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for biomedical information retrieval.

AB Agriculture 4.0 is comprised of different already operational or developing technologies such as robotics, nanotechnology, synthetic protein, cellular agriculture, gene editing technology, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and machine learning, which may have pervasive effects on future agriculture and food systems and major transformative potential. These technologies underpin concepts such as vertical farming and food systems, digital agriculture, bioeconomy, circular agriculture, and aquaponics. In this perspective paper, we argue that more attention is needed for the inclusion and exclusion effects of Agriculture 4.0 technologies, and for reflection on how they relate to diverse transition pathways towards sustainable agricultural and food systems driven by mission-oriented innovation systems. This would require processes of responsible innovation, anticipating the potential impacts of Agriculture 4.0 through inclusive processes, and reflecting on and being responsive to emerging effects and where needed adjusting the direction and course of transition pathways.

AB Heat exchangers are applicable in different industries and technologies, and their performance is influenced by different parameters. In addition to experimental and time-consuming computational approaches, intelligent methods can be used for the investigation of heat exchanger performance due to their abilities in accurate prediction and relatively fast performance. The accuracy and applicability of machine learning methods, mainly based on intelligent techniques, in modeling and forecasting the performance of heat exchangers are dependent on some factors including architecture of algorithm, inputs of the model, and complexity of the system. Owing to the aforementioned facts, it would be crucial to consider the influential factors in the proposed mode to produce models with the greatest accuracy. In this work, different applications of intelligent methods in performance modeling heat exchangers are reviewed, and the key outcomes of the reviewed works are represented. Moreover, the items influencing the performance of these methods are investigated. In the final stage of the current paper, some ideas are recommended for future works in the relevant fields.

AB With the modern advanced information and communication technologies in smart grid systems, demand response (DR) has become an effective method for improving grid reliability and reducing energy costs due to the ability to react quickly to supply-demand mismatches by adjusting flexible loads on the demand side. This paper proposes a dynamic pricing DR algorithm for energy management in a hierarchical electricity market that considers both service provider's (SP) profit and customers' (CUs) costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) is used to illustrate the hierarchical decision-making framework, in which the dynamic pricing problem is formulated as a discrete finite Markov decision process (MDP), and Q-learning is adopted to solve this decision-making problem. Using RL, the SP can adaptively decide the retail electricity price during the on-line learning process where the uncertainty of CUs' load demand profiles and the flexibility of wholesale electricity prices are addressed. Simulation results show that this proposed DR algorithm, can promote SP profitability, reduce energy costs for CUs, balance energy supply and demand in the electricity market, and improve the reliability of electric power systems, which can be regarded as a win-win strategy for both SP and CUs.

AB Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.

AB Building on the notion of a particle physics detector as a camera and the collimated streams of high energy particles, or jets, it measures as an image, we investigate the potential of machine learning techniques based on deep learning architectures to identify highly boosted W bosons. Modern deep learning algorithms trained on jet image scan out-perform standard physically-motivated feature driven approaches to jet tagging. We develop techniques for visualizing how these features are learned by the network and what additional information is used to improve performance. This interplay between physically-motivated feature driven tools and supervised learning algorithms is general and can be used to significantly increase the sensitivity to discover new particles and new forces, and gain a deeper understanding of the physics within jets.

AB Ensemble learning is a prolific field in Machine Learning since it is based on the assumption that combining the output of multiple models is better than using a single model, and it usually provides good results. Normally, it has been commonly employed for classification, but it can be used to improve other disciplines such as feature selection. Feature selection consists of selecting the relevant features for a problem and discard those irrelevant or redundant, with the main goal of improving classification accuracy. In this work, we provide the reader with the basic concepts necessary to build an ensemble for feature selection, as well as reviewing the up-to-date advances and commenting on the future trends that are still to be faced.

AB Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a notoriously challenging ill-posed problem that aims to obtain a high-resolution output from one of its low-resolution versions. Recently, powerful deep learning algorithms have been applied to SISR and have achieved state-of-the-art performance. In this survey, we review representative deep learning-based SISR methods and group them into two categories according to their contributions to two essential aspects of SISR: The exploration of efficient neural network architectures for SISR and the development of effective optimization objectives for deep SISR learning. For each category, a baseline is first established, and several critical limitations of the baseline are summarized. Then, representative works on overcoming these limitations are presented based on their original content, as well as our critical exposition and analyses, and relevant comparisons are conducted from a variety of perspectives. Finally, we conclude this review with some current challenges and future trends in SISR that leverage deep learning algorithms.

ID TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; SERIES MODELS; SPACE
AB We develop a deep learning model to predict traffic flows. The main contribution is development of an architecture that combines a linear model that is fitted using l(1) regularization and a sequence of tanh layers. The challenge of predicting traffic flows are the sharp non-linearities due to transitions between free flow, breakdown, recovery and congestion. We show that deep learning architectures can capture these nonlinear spatio-temporal effects. The first layer identifies spatio-temporal relations among predictors and other layers model nonlinear relations. We illustrate our methodology on road sensor data from Interstate I-55 and predict traffic flows during two special events; a Chicago Bears football game and an extreme snowstorm event. Both cases have sharp traffic flow regime changes, occurring very suddenly, and we show how deep learning provides precise short term traffic flow predictions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB UAVs-unmanned aerial vehicles-facilitate data acquisition at temporal and spatial scales that still remain unachievable for traditional remote sensing platforms. However, current legal frameworks that regulate UAVs present significant barriers to research and development. To highlight the importance, impact, and diversity of UAV regulations, this paper provides an exploratory investigation of UAV regulations on the global scale. For this, the methodological approach consists of a research synthesis of UAV regulations, including a thorough literature review and a comparative analysis of national regulatory frameworks. Similarities and contrasting elements in the various national UAV regulations are explored including their statuses from the perspectives of past, present, and future trends. Since the early 2000s, countries have gradually established national legal frameworks. Although all UAV regulations have one common goal-minimizing the risks to other airspace users and to both people and property on the ground-the results reveal distinct variations in all the compared variables. Furthermore, besides the clear presence of legal frameworks, market forces such as industry design standards and reliable information about UAVs as public goods are expected to shape future developments.

AB Seagrass ecosystems are highly sensitive to environmental change. They are also in global decline and under threat from a variety of anthropogenic factors. There is now an urgency to establish robust monitoring methodologies so that changes in seagrass abundance and distribution in these sensitive coastal environments can be understood. Typical monitoring approaches have included remote sensing from satellites and airborne platforms, ground based ecological surveys and snorkel/scuba surveys. These techniques can suffer from temporal and spatial inconsistency, or are very localised making it hard to assess seagrass meadows in a structured manner. Here we present a novel technique using a lightweight (sub 7 kg) drone and consumer grade cameras to produce very high spatial resolution (similar to 4 mm pixel(-1)) mosaics of two intertidal sites in Wales, UK. We present a full data collection methodology followed by a selection of classification techniques to produce coverage estimates at each site. We trialled three classification approaches of varying complexity to investigate and illustrate the differing performance and capabilities of each. Our results show that unsupervised classifications perform better than object based methods in classifying seagrass cover. We also found that the more sparsely vegetated of the two meadows studied was more accurately classified - it had lower root mean squared deviation (RMSD) between observed and classified coverage (9-9.5%) compared to a more densely vegetated meadow (RMSD 16-22%). Furthermore, we examine the potential to detect other biotic features, finding that lugworm mounds can be detected visually at coarser resolutions such as 43 mm pixel(-1), whereas smaller features such as cockle shells within seagrass require finer grained data (<17 mm pixel(-1)).

AB The application of deep learning for automated segmentation (delineation of boundaries) of histologic primitives (structures) from whole slide images can facilitate the establishment of novel protocols for kidney biopsy assessment. Here, we developed and validated deep learning networks for the segmentation of histologic structures on kidney biopsies and nephrectomies. For development, we examined 125 biopsies for Minimal Change Disease collected across 29 NEPTUNE enrolling centers along with 459 whole slide images stained with Hematoxylin & Eosin (125), Periodic Acid Schiff (125), Silver (102), and Trichrome (107) divided into training, validation and testing sets (ratio 6:1:3). Histologic structures were manually segmented (30048 total annotations) by five nephropathologists. Twenty deep learning models were trained with optimal digital magnification across the structures and stains. Periodic Acid Schiff-stained whole slide images yielded the best concordance between pathologists and deep learning segmentation across all structures (F-scores: 0.93 for glomerular tufts, 0.94 for glomerular tuft plus Bowman's capsule, 0.91 for proximal tubules, 0.93 for distal tubular segments, 0.81 for peritubular capillaries, and 0.85 for arteries and afferent arterioles). Optimal digital magnifications were 5X for glomerular tuft/tuft plus Bowman's capsule, 10X for proximal/distal tubule, arteries and afferent arterioles, and 40X for peritubular capillaries. Silver stained whole slide images yielded the worst deep learning performance. Thus, this largest study to date adapted deep learning for the segmentation of kidney histologic structures across multiple stains and pathology laboratories. All data used for training and testing and a detailed online tutorial will be publicly available.

DT Article
DE Airborne images; co-occurrence relations; contextual information;
   feature decoupling; semantic segmentation
AB Contextual information has been demonstrated to be helpful for airborne image segmentation. However, most of the previous works focus on the exploitation of spatially contextual information, which is difficult to segment isolated objects, mainly surrounded by uncorrelated objects. To alleviate this issue, we attempt to take advantage of the co-occurrence relations between different classes of objects in the scene. Especially, similar to other works, convolutional features are first extracted to capture the spatially contextual information. Then, a feature decoupling module is designed to encode the class co-occurrence relations into the convolutional features; thus, the most discriminative features can be decoupled. Finally, the segmentation result is inferred from the decoupled features. The whole process is integrated to form an end-to-end network, named class-guided feature decoupling network (CGFDN). Experimental results on two widely used benchmark data sets show that CGFDN obtains competitive results (>90% overall accuracy (OA) on 5-cmresolution Potsdam and >91% OA on 9-cm-resolution Vaihingen) in comparison with several state-of-the-art models.

AB Image restoration is a long-standing problem in low-level computer vision with many interesting applications. We describe a flexible learning framework based on the concept of nonlinear reaction diffusion models for various image restoration problems. By embodying recent improvements in nonlinear diffusion models, we propose a dynamic nonlinear reaction diffusion model with time-dependent parameters (i.e., linear filters and influence functions). In contrast to previous nonlinear diffusion models, all the parameters, including the filters and the influence functions, are simultaneously learned from training data through a loss based approach. We call this approach TNRD-Trainable Nonlinear Reaction Diffusion. The TNRD approach is applicable for a variety of image restoration tasks by incorporating appropriate reaction force. We demonstrate its capabilities with three representative applications, Gaussian image denoising, single image super resolution and JPEG deblocking. Experiments show that our trained nonlinear diffusion models largely benefit from the training of the parameters and finally lead to the best reported performance on common test datasets for the tested applications. Our trained models preserve the structural simplicity of diffusion models and take only a small number of diffusion steps, thus are highly efficient. Moreover, they are also well-suited for parallel computation on GPUs, which makes the inference procedure extremely fast.

AB With the fast advancements of electronic chip technologies in the Internet of Things (IoT), it is urgent to address the copyright protection issue of intellectual property (IP) circuit resources of the electronic devices in IoT environments. In this article, a fast deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL)-based detection algorithm for virtual IP watermarks is proposed by combining the technologies of mapping function and DRL to preprocess the ownership information of the IP circuit resource. The deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithm is used to generate the watermarked positions adaptively, making the watermarked positions secure yet close to the original design, turning the watermarked positions secure. An artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm is utilized for training the position distance characteristic vectors of the IP circuit, in which the characteristic function of the virtual position for IP watermark is generated after training. In IP ownership verification, the DRL model can quickly locate the range of virtual watermark positions. With the characteristic values of the virtual positions in each lookup table (LUT) area and surrounding areas, the mapping position relationship can be calculated in a supervised manner in the neural network, as the algorithm realizes the fast location of the real ownership information in an IP circuit. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the speed of watermark detection as also reducing the resource overhead. Besides, it also achieves excellent performance in security.

DT Article
ID DESIGN; INTERFEROMETERS; OPTICS
AB Recently, integrated optics has gained interest as a hardware platform for implementing machine learning algorithms. Of particular interest are artificial neural networks, since matrix-vector multiplications, which are used heavily in artificial neural networks, can be done efficiently in photonic circuits. The training of an artificial neural network is a crucial step in its application. However, currently on the integrated photonics platform there is no efficient protocol for the training of these networks. In this work, we introduce a method that enables highly efficient, in situ training of a photonic neural network. We use adjoint variable methods to derive the photonic analogue of the backpropagation algorithm, which is the standard method for computing gradients of conventional neural networks. We further show how these gradients may be obtained exactly by performing intensity measurements within the device. As an application, we demonstrate the training of a numerically simulated photonic artificial neural network. Beyond the training of photonic machine learning implementations, our method may also be of broad interest to experimental sensitivity analysis of photonic systems and the optimization of reconfigurable optics platforms.

AB Extraction of discriminative features from salient facial patches plays a vital role in effective facial expression recognition. The accurate detection of facial landmarks improves the localization of the salient patches on face images. This paper proposes a novel framework for expression recognition by using appearance features of selected facial patches. A few prominent facial patches, depending on the position of facial landmarks, are extracted which are active during emotion elicitation. These active patches are further processed to obtain the salient patches which contain discriminative features for classification of each pair of expressions, thereby selecting different facial patches as salient for different pair of expression classes. One-against-one classification method is adopted using these features. In addition, an automated learning-free facial landmark detection technique has been proposed, which achieves similar performances as that of other state-of-art landmark detection methods, yet requires significantly less execution time. The proposed method is found to perform well consistently in different resolutions, hence, providing a solution for expression recognition in low resolution images. Experiments on CK+ and JAFFE facial expression databases show the effectiveness of the proposed system.

AB The rapid improvement in the global connectivity standards has escalated the level of trade taking place among different parties. Advanced communication standards are allowing the trade of all types of commodities and services. Furthermore, the goods and services developed in a particular region are transcending boundaries to enter into foreign markets. Supply chains play an essential role in the trade of these goods. To be able to realize a connected world with no boundary restrictions in terms of goods and services, it is imperative to keep the associated supply chains transparent, secure, and trustworthy. Therefore, some fundamental changes in the current supply chain architecture are essential to achieve a secure trade environment. This article discusses the supply chain's security-critical application areas and presents a detailed survey of the security issues in the existing supply chain architecture. Various emerging technologies, such as blockchain, machine learning (ML), and physically unclonable functions (PUFs) as solutions to the vulnerabilities in the existing infrastructure of the supply chain have also been discussed. Recent studies reviewed in this work reveal a growing sentiment in the industry toward new and emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and ML. While many organizations have already adopted IoT applications and artificial intelligence systems in their businesses, widespread adoption of blockchain remains distant. It has also been found that over the past decade, PUF-based authentication systems have gained much ground. However, a proper reference model for their implementation in complex supply chains is still missing.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to conduct a state-of-the-art review of the ongoing research on the Industry 4.0 phenomenon, highlight its key design principles and technology trends, identify its architectural design and offer a strategic roadmap that can serve manufacturers as a simple guide for the process of Industry 4.0 transition.
   Design/methodology/approach The study performs a systematic and content-centric review of literature based on a six-stage approach to identify key design principles and technology trends of Industry 4.0. The study further benefits from a comprehensive content analysis of the 178 documents identified, both manually and via IBM Watson's natural language processing for advanced text analysis.
   Findings Industry 4.0 is an integrative system of value creation that is comprised of 12 design principles and 14 technology trends. Industry 4.0 is no longer a hype and manufacturers need to get on board sooner rather than later.
   Research limitations/implications The strategic roadmap presented in this study can serve academicians and practitioners as a stepping stone for development of a detailed strategic roadmap for successful transition from traditional manufacturing into the Industry 4.0. However, there is no one-size-fits-all strategy that suits all businesses or industries, meaning that the Industry 4.0 roadmap for each company is idiosyncratic, and should be devised based on company's core competencies, motivations, capabilities, intent, goals, priorities and budgets.
   Practical implications The first step for transitioning into the Industry 4.0 is the development of a comprehensive strategic roadmap that carefully identifies and plans every single step a manufacturing company needs to take, as well as the timeline, and the costs and benefits associated with each step. The strategic roadmap presented in this study can offer as a holistic view of common steps that manufacturers need to undertake in their transition toward the Industry 4.0.
   Originality/value The study is among the first to identify, cluster and describe design principles and technology trends that are building blocks of the Industry 4.0. The strategic roadmap for Industry 4.0 transition presented in this study is expected to assist contemporary manufacturers to understand what implementing the Industry 4.0 really requires of them and what challenges they might face during the transition process.

AB Time-series data is widely adopted in condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of wind turbines as well as other energy systems, where long-term dependency is essential to form the classifiable features. To address the issues that the traditional approaches either rely on expert knowledge and handcrafted features or do not fully model long-term dependencies hidden in time-domain signals, this work presents a novel fault diagnosis framework based on an end-to-end Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model, to learn features directly from multivariate time-series data and capture long-term dependencies through recurrent behaviour and gates mechanism of LSTM. Experimental results on two wind turbine datasets show that our method is able to do fault classification effectively from raw time-series signals collected by single or multiple sensors and outperforms state-of-art approaches. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed framework is validated through the experiments on small dataset with limited data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Motion estimation (ME) and motion compensation (MC) have been widely used for classical video frame interpolation systems over the past decades. Recently, a number of data-driven frame interpolation methods based on convolutional neural networks have been proposed. However, existing learning based methods typically estimate either flow or compensation kernels, thereby limiting performance on both computational efficiency and interpolation accuracy. In this work, we propose a motion estimation and compensation driven neural network for video frame interpolation. A novel adaptive warping layer is developed to integrate both optical flow and interpolation kernels to synthesize target frame pixels. This layer is fully differentiable such that both the flow and kernel estimation networks can be optimized jointly. The proposed model benefits from the advantages of motion estimation and compensation methods without using hand-crafted features. Compared to existing methods, our approach is computationally efficient and able to generate more visually appealing results. Furthermore, the proposed MEMC-Net architecture can be seamlessly adapted to several video enhancement tasks, e.g., super-resolution, denoising, and deblocking. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art video frame interpolation and enhancement algorithms on a wide range of datasets.

AB Machine learning (ML) models have been widely used in the modeling, design and prediction in energy systems. During the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the advancement and application of various types of ML models for energy systems. This paper presents the state of the art of ML models used in energy systems along with a novel taxonomy of models and applications. Through a novel methodology, ML models are identified and further classified according to the ML modeling technique, energy type, and application area. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the literature leads to an assessment and performance evaluation of the ML models and their applications, and a discussion of the major challenges and opportunities for prospective research. This paper further concludes that there is an outstanding rise in the accuracy, robustness, precision and generalization ability of the ML models in energy systems using hybrid ML models. Hybridization is reported to be effective in the advancement of prediction models, particularly for renewable energy systems, e.g., solar energy, wind energy, and biofuels. Moreover, the energy demand prediction using hybrid models of ML have highly contributed to the energy efficiency and therefore energy governance and sustainability.

AB Reaction prediction and retrosynthesis are the cornerstones of organic chemistry. Rule-based expert systems have been the most widespread approach to computationally solve these two related challenges to date. However, reaction rules often fail because they ignore the molecular context, which leads to reactivity conflicts. Herein, we report that deep neural networks can learn to resolve reactivity conflicts and to prioritize the most suitable transformation rules. We show that by training our model on 3.5million reactions taken from the collective published knowledge of the entire discipline of chemistry, our model exhibits a top10-accuracy of 95% in retrosynthesis and 97% for reaction prediction on a validation set of almost 1million reactions.

AB Existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require a fixed-size (e.g., 224x224) input image. This requirement is "artificial" and may reduce the recognition accuracy for the images or sub-images of an arbitrary size/scale. In this work, we equip the networks with another pooling strategy, "spatial pyramid pooling", to eliminate the above requirement. The new network structure, called SPP-net, can generate a fixed-length representation regardless of image size/scale. Pyramid pooling is also robust to object deformations. With these advantages, SPP-net should in general improve all CNN-based image classification methods. On the ImageNet 2012 dataset, we demonstrate that SPP-net boosts the accuracy of a variety of CNN architectures despite their different designs. On the Pascal VOC 2007 and Caltech101 datasets, SPP-net achieves state-of-the-art classification results using a single full-image representation and no fine-tuning. The power of SPP-net is also significant in object detection. Using SPP-net, we compute the feature maps from the entire image only once, and then pool features in arbitrary regions (sub-images) to generate fixed-length representations for training the detectors. This method avoids repeatedly computing the convolutional features. In processing test images, our method is 24-102x faster than the R-CNN method, while achieving better or comparable accuracy on Pascal VOC 2007. In ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2014, our methods rank #2 in object detection and #3 in image classification among all 38 teams. This manuscript also introduces the improvement made for this competition.

AB As a qualitative process, classification of subsurface lithofacies is very important for the characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Machine learning has been a potential method to automate the prediction of this parameter based on the well-logging data. In order to incorporate the geological trend into the classification process, a Bayesian approach has been designed in this letter, in which the Markov transition matrix is added. Compared with the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), a typical representative of machine learning, the proposed Bayesian-ANN (B-ANN), can honor the lithofacies orderings in the vertical direction. A better performance of B-ANN can be observed in the precision-recall curves, as well as indicated by larger values of the average precision. Because of the dominance in the internal transitions within the lithofacies themselves, the posterior probabilities of each lithofacies in B-ANN are less varied than those in ANN.

AB This paper addresses the problem of supervised video summarization by formulating it as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem, where the input is a sequence of original video frames, and the output is a keyshot sequence. Our key idea is to learn a deep summarization network with attention mechanism to mimic the way of selecting the keyshots of human. To this end, we propose a novel video summarization framework named attentive encoder-decoder networks for video summarization (AVS), in which the encoder uses a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) to encode the contextual information among the input video frames. As for the decoder, two attention-based LSTM networks are explored by using additive and multiplicative objective functions, respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on two video summarization benchmark datasets, i.e., SumMe and TVSum. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed AVS-based approaches against the state-of-the-art approaches, with remarkable improvements on both datasets.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Information security has become a key issue of public concern recently. In order to radically resist the decryption and analysis in the field of image information hiding and significantly improve the security of the secret information, a novel coverless information hiding approach based on deep learning is proposed in this paper. Deep learning can select the appropriate carrier according to requirements to achieve real-time image data hiding and the high-level semantic features extracted by CNN are more accurate than the low-level features. This method does not need to employ the designated image for embedding the secret data but transfer a set of real-time stego-images which share one or several visually similar blocks with the given secret image. In this approach, a group of real-time images searched online are segmented according to specific requirements. Then, the DenseNet is used to extract the high-level semantic features of each similar block. At the same time, a robust hash sequence with feature sequence, DC and location is generated by DCT. The inverted index structure based on the hash sequence is constructed to attain real-time image matching efficiently. At the sending end, the stego-images are matched and sent through feature retrieval. At the receiving end, the secret image can be recovered by extracting similar blocks through the received stego-images and stitching the image blocks according to the location information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method without any modification traces provides better robustness and has higher retrieval accuracy and capacity when compared with some existing coverless image information hiding.

AB Despite rapid advances in sequencing technologies, accurately calling genetic variants present in an individual genome from billions of short, errorful sequence reads remains challenging. Here we show that a deep convolutional neural network can call genetic variation in aligned next-generation sequencing read data by learning statistical relationships between images of read pileups around putative variant and true genotype calls. The approach, called DeepVariant, outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools. The learned model generalizes across genome builds and mammalian species, allowing nonhuman sequencing projects to benefit from the wealth of human ground-truth data. We further show that DeepVariant can learn to call variants in a variety of sequencing technologies and experimental designs, including deep whole genomes from 10X Genomics and Ion Ampliseq exomes, highlighting the benefits of using more automated and generalizable techniques for variant calling.

AB Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted in research areas concerned with sequential data, such as text, audio, and video. However, RNNs consisting of sigma cells or tanh cells are unable to learn the relevant information of input data when the input gap is large. By introducing gate functions into the cell structure, the long short-term memory (LSTM) could handle the problem of long-term dependencies well. Since its introduction, almost all the exciting results based on RNNs have been achieved by the LSTM. The LSTM has become the focus of deep learning. We review the LSTM cell and its variants to explore the learning capacity of the LSTM cell. Furthermore, the LSTM networks are divided into two broad categories: LSTM-dominated networks and integrated LSTM networks. In addition, their various applications are discussed. Finally, future research directions are presented for LSTM networks.

AB Civil engineering uses digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthophotos as basic material to be able to design and execute any project. UAV photogranunetry has made it possible to obtain this type of information in an economic and practical way. However, it is necessary to know the accuracy of the data and that it is within the admissible limits. There are many factors that affect the accuracy of products resulting from UAV photogrammetry. Of all of these, the effect of the number of ground control points (GCPs) and their distribution in the study area are especially significant. Different distributions of GCPs have been studied to try to optimize the products obtained by UAV photogrammetry. Of all the distributions tested, the best results were obtained with edge distribution and stratified distribution. Therefore, it is necessary to place GCPs around the edge of the study area to minimize planimetry errors. In addition, it is advisable to create a stratified distribution inside the study area with a density of around 0.5-1 GCP x ha(-1) to minimize altimetry errors. The combination of these two distributions minimizes the total error obtained.

AB Accurate and real-time traffic flow prediction plays a central role for efficient traffic management. Software Defined Networking (SDN) is one of the key concerns in networking that has caught much attention in recent years. Extensive advancement in software-based configurable equipment has made ready for a new networking paradigm called software-defined vehicular networks (SDVNs). In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for implementing an artificially intelligent model for vehicular traffic behavior prediction. We combine the flexibility, scalability, and adaptability leveraged by the SDVN architecture along with the machine learning algorithms to model the traffic flow efficiently. First, we introduce an ingenious approach to find congestion sensitive spots in the VANET by means of clustering algorithm and then predicting the future traffic densities for each spot by recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Neural networks (NNs) have been extensively used to model short-term traffic prediction in the past years. We construct a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM-NN) architecture which overcomes the issue of back-propagated error decay through memory blocks for spatiotemporal traffic prediction with high temporal dependency. Due to such learning ability, LSTM can capture the stochastic characteristics and non-linear nature of the traffic flow. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach shows that it has the potential to predict real-time traffic trends accurately with Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 3.0e - 3 in the scaled metrics, which is equivalent to 97% accuracy in traffic density prediction.

AB The precise estimation and forecast of the safety factor (SF) in civil engineering applications is considered as an important issue to reduce engineering risk. The present research investigates new artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for the prediction of SF values of retaining walls, as important and resistant structures for ground forces. These structures have complicated performances in dynamic conditions. Consequently, more than 8000 designs of these structures were dynamically evaluated. Two AI models, namely the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA)-artificial neural network (ANN), and the genetic algorithm (GA)-ANN were used for the forecasting of SF values. In order to design intelligent models, parameters i.e., the wall thickness, stone density, wall height, soil density, and internal soil friction angle were examined under different dynamic conditions and assigned as inputs to predict SF of retaining walls. Various models of these systems were constructed and compared with each other to obtain the best one. Results of models indicated that although both hybrid models are able to predict SF values with a high accuracy and they can be introduced as new models in the field, the retaining wall performance could be properly predicted in dynamic conditions using the ICA-ANN model. Under these conditions, a combination of engineering design and artificial intelligence techniques can be used to control and secure retaining walls in dynamic conditions.

AB This paper envisions a mixed network with autonomous vehicle (AV) expressways and non-autonomous local streets in the future, where a trip may consist of both the AV self-driving part and the manual-driving part. A linear traffic corridor approach is adopted, where AV expressways and non-autonomous streets are in parallel and are connected through the entrance/exit. This mimics the intermediate future where AV expressways may be initially deployed along major corridors. We model and analyze road users route choice in such a mixed network. We also examine how AV expressways are integrated with the local streets can affect system performance.

AB The explosive data traffic and connections in 5G networks require the use of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to accommodate more users. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be exploited with NOMA to improve the situation further. In this paper, we propose a UAV-assisted NOMA network, in which the UAV and base station (BS) cooperate with each other to serve ground users simultaneously. The sum rate is maximized by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory and the NOMA precoding. To solve the optimization, we decompose it into two steps. First, the sum rate of the UAV-served users is maximized via alternate user scheduling and UAV trajectory with its interference to the BS-served users below a threshold. Then, the optimal NOMA precoding vectors are obtained using two schemes with different constraints. The first scheme intends to cancel the interference from the BS to the UAV-served user, while the second one restricts the interference to a given threshold. In both schemes, the non-convex optimization problems are converted into tractable ones. An iterative algorithm is designed. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms for the hybrid NOMA and UAV network.

Implementation of such optimisation on aircraft conceptual design will greatly benefit a design team, as a great number of trade-off design solutions are provided for further decision making. In this paper, a many-objective optimisation problem for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is posed with 6 objective functions: take-off gross weight, drag coefficient, take off distance, power required, lift coefficient and endurance subject to aircraft performance and stability constraints. Aerodynamic analysis is carried out using a vortex lattice method, while aircraft component weights are estimated empirically. A new self-adaptive meta-heuristic based on decomposition is specifically developed for this design problem. The new algorithm along with nine established and recently developed multi-objective and many-objective meta-heuristics are employed to solve the problem, while comparative performance is made based upon a hypervolume indicator. The results reveal that the proposed optimiser is the best performer for this design task. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Radiomics describes a broad set of computational methods that extract quantitative features from radiographic images. The resulting features can be used to inform imaging diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy response in oncology. However, major challenges remain for methodologic developments to optimize feature extraction and provide rapid information flow in clinical settings. Equally important, to be clinically useful, predictive radiomic properties must be clearly linked to meaningful biologic characteristics and qualitative imaging properties familiar to radiologists. Here we use a cross-disciplinary approach to highlight studies in radiomics. We review brain tumor radiologic studies (eg, imaging interpretation) through computational models (eg, computer vision and machine learning) that provide novel clinical insights. We outline current quantitative image feature extraction and prediction strategies with different levels of available clinical classes for supporting clinical decision-making. We further discuss machine-learning challenges and data opportunities to advance radiomic studies.

AB The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is a promising enabler of the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, due to its agile maneuverability. In this paper, we explore the potential gain of UAV-aided data collection in a generalized IoT scenario. Particularly, a composite channel model, including both large-scale and small-scale fading is used to depict typical propagation environments. Moreover, rigorous energy constraints are considered to characterize IoT devices as practically as possible. A multiantenna UAV is employed, which can communicate with a cluster of single-antenna IoT devices to form a virtual MIMO link. We formulate a whole-trajectory-oriented optimization problem, where the transmission duration and the transmit power of all devices are jointly designed to maximize the data collection efficiency for the whole flight. Different from previous studies, only the slowly varying large-scale channel state information is assumed available, to coincide with the fact that practically it is quite difficult to predictively acquire the random small-scale channel fading prior to the UAV flight. We propose an iterative scheme to overcome the nonconvexity of the formulated problem. The presented scheme can provide a significant performance gain over traditional schemes and converges quickly.

AB This paper describes a framework using disruptive technologies for COVID-19 analysis. Disruptive technologies include high-tech and emerging technologies such as AI, industry 4.0, IoT, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), big data, virtual reality (VR), Drone technology, and Autonomous Robots, 5 G, and blockchain to offer digital transformation, research and development and service delivery. Disruptive technologies are essential for Industry 4.0 development, which can be applied to many disciplines. In this paper, we present a framework that uses disruptive technologies for COVID-19 analysis. The proposed framework restricts the spread of COVID-19 outbreaks, ensures the safety of the healthcare teams and maintains patients' physical and psychological healthcare conditions. The framework is designed to deal with the severe shortage of PPE for the medical team, reduce the massive pressure on hospitals, and track recovered patients to treat COVID-19 patients with plasma. The study provides oversight for governments on how to adopt technologies to reduce the impact of unprecedented outbreaks for COVID-19. Our work illustrates an empirical case study on the analysis of real COVID-19 patients and shows the importance of the proposed intelligent framework to limit the current outbreaks for COVID-19. The aim is to help the healthcare team make rapid decisions to treat COVID-19 patients in hospitals, home quarantine, or identifying and treating patients with typical cold or flu.

AB We present ilastik, an easy-to-use interactive tool that brings machine-learning-based (bio)image analysis to end users without substantial computational expertise. It contains pre-defined workflows for image segmentation, object classification, counting and tracking. Users adapt the workflows to the problem at hand by interactively providing sparse training annotations for a non-linear classifier. ilastik can process data in up to five dimensions (3D, time and number of channels). Its computational back end runs operations on-demand wherever possible, allowing for interactive prediction on data larger than RAM. Once the classifiers are trained, ilastik workflows can be applied to new data from the command line without further user interaction. We describe all ilastik workflows in detail, including three case studies and a discussion on the expected performance.

AB Correct estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) is necessary for accurate crop growth monitoring and yield prediction. We estimated AGB based on images obtained with a snapshot hyperspectral sensor (UHD 185 firefly, Cubert GmbH, Ulm, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany) mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The UHD 185 images were used to calculate the crop height and hyperspectral reflectance of winter wheat canopies from hyperspectral and panchromatic images. We constructed several single-parameter models for AGB estimation based on spectral parameters, such as specific bands, spectral indices (e.g., Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), NDVI, Greenness Index (GI) and Wide Dynamic Range VI (WDRVI)) and crop height and several models combined with spectral parameters and crop height. Comparison with experimental results indicated that incorporating crop height into the models improved the accuracy of AGB estimations (the average AGB is 6.45 t/ha). The estimation accuracy of single-parameter models was low (crop height only: R-2 = 0.50, RMSE = 1.62 t/ha, MAE = 1.24 t/ha; R-670 only: R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 1.55 t/ha, MAE = 1.23 t/ha; NDVI only: R-2 = 0.37, RMSE = 1.81 t/ha, MAE = 1.47 t/ha; partial least squares regression R-2 = 0.53, RMSE = 1.69, MAE = 1.20), but accuracy increased when crop height and spectral parameters were combined (partial least squares regression modeling: R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 1.08 t/ha, MAE = 0.83 t/ha; verification: R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 1.20 t/ha, MAE = 0.96 t/ha). Our results suggest that crop height determined from the new UAV-based snapshot hyperspectral sensor can improve AGB estimation and is advantageous for mapping applications. This new method can be used to guide agricultural management.

AB Systems neuroscience seeks explanations for how the brain implements a wide variety of perceptual, cognitive and motor tasks. Conversely, artificial intelligence attempts to design computational systems based on the tasks they will have to solve. In artificial neural networks, the three components specified by design are the objective functions, the learning rules and the architectures. With the growing success of deep learning, which utilizes brain-inspired architectures, these three designed components have increasingly become central to how we model, engineer and optimize complex artificial learning systems. Here we argue that a greater focus on these components would also benefit systems neuroscience. We give examples of how this optimization-based framework can drive theoretical and experimental progress in neuroscience. We contend that this principled perspective on systems neuroscience will help to generate more rapid progress.

TI The Artificial Intelligence Clinician learns optimal treatment

LA English
DT Article
ID INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS DEFINITIONS; SEPTIC SHOCK; MORTALITY; MEDICINE;
   CRITERIA; THERAPY; ADULTS
AB Sepsis is the third leading cause of death worldwide and the main cause of mortality in hospitals(1-3), but the best treatment strategy remains uncertain. In particular, evidence suggests that current practices in the administration of intravenous fluids and vasopressors are suboptimal and likely induce harm in a proportion of patients(1,4-6). To tackle this sequential decision-making problem, we developed a reinforcement learning agent, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Clinician, which extracted implicit knowledge from an amount of patient data that exceeds by many-fold the life-time experience of human clinicians and learned optimal treatment by analyzing a myriad of (mostly suboptimal) treatment decisions. We demonstrate that the value of the AI Clinician's selected treatment is on average reliably higher than human clinicians. In a large validation cohort independent of the training data, mortality was lowest in patients for whom clinicians' actual doses matched the AI decisions. Our model provides individualized and clinically interpretable treatment decisions for sepsis that could improve patient outcomes.

AB In recent years, with the rapid development of current Internet and mobile communication technologies, the infrastructure, devices and resources in networking systems are becoming more complex and heterogeneous. In order to efficiently organize, manage, maintain and optimize networking systems, more intelligence needs to be deployed. However, due to the inherently distributed feature of traditional networks, machine learning techniques are hard to be applied and deployed to control and operate networks. Software defined networking (SDN) brings us new chances to provide intelligence inside the networks. The capabilities of SDN (e.g., logically centralized control, global view of the network, software-based traffic analysis, and dynamic updating of forwarding rules) make it easier to apply machine learning techniques. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the literature involving machine learning algorithms applied to SDN. First, the related works and background knowledge are introduced. Then, we present an overview of machine learning algorithms. In addition, we review how machine learning algorithms are applied in the realm of SDN, from the perspective of traffic classification, routing optimization, quality of service/quality of experience prediction, resource management and security. Finally, challenges and broader perspectives are discussed.

AB Image denoising has been foremost concern in the field of medical imaging (MI). For image denoising, the most challenging is to protect the data bearing structures such as edges and surfaces to get good visual quality while enhancing Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). In this work, an inventive bio-inspired optimization based filtering system is considered for the MI denoising process, the filter named as Bilateral Filter (BF). The execution of the denoising process influences the decision of selecting the optimal parameters, i.e., Gaussian and spatial weights. Here, these parameters are chosen by utilizing swarm based optimization that is Dragonfly (DF) and Modified Firefly (MFF) algorithm. For this parameter selection, multiobjective fitness function (PSNR and vector root mean square error (VRMSE)) is utilized. Moreover, Convolutional based Neural Network (CNN) classifier is used to classify the denoised image as normal or abnormal, with better classification rate. From the experimental results the proposed model, PSNR of 47.52 dB and error rate of 1.23 is attained contrasting to the existing filters and some classifiers. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ab initio protein secondary structure (SS) predictions are utilized to generate tertiary structure predictions, which are increasingly demanded due to the rapid discovery of proteins. Although recent developments have slightly exceeded previous methods of SS prediction, accuracy has stagnated around 80 percent and many wonder if prediction cannot be advanced beyond this ceiling. Disciplines that have traditionally employed neural networks are experimenting with novel deep learning techniques in attempts to stimulate progress. Since neural networks have historically played an important role in SS prediction, we wanted to determine whether deep learning could contribute to the advancement of this field as well. We developed an SS predictor that makes use of the position-specific scoring matrix generated by PSI-BLAST and deep learning network architectures, which we call DNSS. Graphical processing units and CUDA software optimize the deep network architecture and efficiently train the deep networks. Optimal parameters for the training process were determined, and a workflow comprising three separately trained deep networks was constructed in order to make refined predictions. This deep learning network approach was used to predict SS for a fully independent test dataset of 198 proteins, achieving a Q(3) accuracy of 80.7 percent and a Sov accuracy of 74.2 percent.

AB One of the most exciting tools that have entered the material science toolbox in recent years is machine learning. This collection of statistical methods has already proved to be capable of considerably speeding up both fundamental and applied research. At present, we are witnessing an explosion of works that develop and apply machine learning to solid-state systems. We provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the most recent research in this topic. As a starting point, we introduce machine learning principles, algorithms, descriptors, and databases in materials science. We continue with the description of different machine learning approaches for the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure. Then we discuss research in numerous quantitative structure-property relationships and various approaches for the replacement of first-principle methods by machine learning. We review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can be applied to improve the rational design process and related examples of applications. Two major questions are always the interpretability of and the physical understanding gained from machine learning models. We consider therefore the different facets of interpretability and their importance in materials science. Finally, we propose solutions and future research paths for various challenges in computational materials science.

AB We employ adaptive activation functions for regression in deep and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate smooth and discontinuous functions as well as solutions of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations. In particular, we solve the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, which has smooth solutions, the nonlinear Burgers equation, which can admit high gradient solutions, and the Helmholtz equation. We introduce a scalable hyper-parameter in the activation function, which can be optimized to achieve best performance of the network as it changes dynamically the topology of the loss function involved in the optimization process. The adaptive activation function has better learning capabilities than the traditional one (fixed activation) as it improves greatly the convergence rate, especially at early training, as well as the solution accuracy. To better understand the learning process, we plot the neural network solution in the frequency domain to examine how the network captures successively different frequency bands present in the solution. We consider both forward problems, where the approximate solutions are obtained, as well as inverse problems, where parameters involved in the governing equation are identified. Our simulation results show that the proposed method is a very simple and effective approach to increase the efficiency, robustness and accuracy of the neural network approximation of nonlinear functions as well as solutions of partial differential equations, especially for forward problems. We theoretically prove that in the proposed method, gradient descent algorithms are not attracted to suboptimal critical points or local minima. Furthermore, the proposed adaptive activation functions are shown to accelerate the minimization process of the loss values in standard deep learning benchmarks using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, MNIST, KMNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Semeion datasets with and without data augmentation.

AB In general, a proportional function is obviously not antiperiodic, yet a very interesting fact in this paper shows that it is possible there is an antiperiodic solution for some proportional delayed dynamical systems. We deal with the issue of antiperiodic solutions for RNNs (recurrent neural networks) incorporating multiproportional delays. Employing Lyapunov method, inequality techniques and concise mathematical analysis proof, sufficient criteria on the existence of antiperiodic solutions including its uniqueness and exponential stability are built up. The obtained results provide us some lights for designing a stable RNNs and complement some earlier publications. In addition, simulations show that the theoretical antiperiodic dynamics are in excellent agreement with the numerically observed behavior.

AB Based on the neural network (NN) approximator, an online reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed for a class of affine multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) nonlinear discrete-time systems with unknown functions and disturbances. In the design procedure, two networks are provided where one is an action network to generate an optimal control signal and the other is a critic network to approximate the cost function. An optimal control signal and adaptation laws can be generated based on two NNs. In the previous approaches, the weights of critic and action networks are updated based on the gradient descent rule and the estimations of optimal weight vectors are directly adjusted in the design. Consequently, compared with the existing results, the main contributions of this paper are: 1) only two parameters are needed to be adjusted, and thus the number of the adaptation laws is smaller than the previous results and 2) the updating parameters do not depend on the number of the subsystems for MIMO systems and the tuning rules are replaced by adjusting the norms on optimal weight vectors in both action and critic networks. It is proven that the tracking errors, the adaptation laws, and the control inputs are uniformly bounded using Lyapunov analysis method. The simulation examples are employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has been in existence for over six decades and has experienced AI winters and springs. The rise of super computing power and Big Data technologies appear to have empowered AI in recent years. The new generation of AI is rapidly expanding and has again become an attractive topic for research. This paper aims to identify the challenges associated with the use and impact of revitalised AI based systems for decision making and offer a set of research propositions for information systems (IS) researchers. The paper first provides a view of the history of AI through the relevant papers published in the International Journal of Information Management (IJIM). It then discusses AI for decision making in general and the specific issues regarding the interaction and integration of AI to support or replace human decision makers in particular. To advance research on the use of AI for decision making in the era of Big Data, the paper offers twelve research propositions for IS researchers in terms of conceptual and theoretical development, AI technology-human interaction, and AI implementation.

AB We present the GPU version of DeePMD-kit, which, upon training a deep neural network model using ab initio data, can drive extremely large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with ab initio accuracy. Our tests show that for a water system of 12, 582, 912 atoms, the GPU version can be 7 times faster than the CPU version under the same power consumption. The code can scale up to the entire Summit supercomputer. For a copper system of 113, 246, 208 atoms, the code can perform one nanosecond MD simulation per day, reaching a peak performance of 86 PFLOPS (43% of the peak). Such unprecedented ability to perform MD simulation with ab initio accuracy opens up the possibility of studying many important issues in materials and molecules, such as heterogeneous catalysis, electrochemical cells, irradiation damage, crack propagation, and biochemical reactions.

AB In the age of big data, companies tend to deploy their services in data centers rather than their own servers. The demands of big data analytics grow significantly, which leads to an extremely high electricity consumption at data centers. In this paper, we investigate the cost minimization problem of big data analytics on geo-distributed data centers connected to renewable energy sources with unpredictable capacity. To solve this problem, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based job scheduling algorithm by combining RL with neural network (NN). Moreover, two techniques are developed to enhance the performance of our proposal. Specifically, Random Pool Sampling (RPS) is proposed to retrain the NN via accumulated training data, and a novel Unidirectional Bridge Network (UBN) structure is designed for further enhancing the training speed by using the historical knowledge stored in the trained NN. Experiment results on real Google cluster traces and electricity price from Energy Information Administration show that our approach is able to reduce the data centers' cost significantly compared with other benchmark algorithms.

AB Cerebralmicro-bleedings are small chronic brain hemorrhages caused by structural abnormalities of the small vessels. CMBs can be found from individuals with stroke at memory clinics and even healthy elderly people. CMBs indicate hemorrhage-prone pathological states. Research shows that CMBs are associated with an increased risk of future ischemic stroke, intra-cerebral hemorrhage (ICH), dementia, and death. Considering that CMBs severely influence people's life, it is necessary to identify the CMBs in an early stage to prevent from further deterioration and to help people live a healthy life. In this paper, we proposed using CNN with stochastic pooling for the CMB detection. CNN has good performance in image and video recognition, recommender system, and nature language processing. Based on the collected subject, the experiment result shows that the six-convolution layer and three fully-connected layer CNN, nine-layers in total, achieved sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision as 97.22%, and 97.35%, 97.28%, and 97.35% in average of ten runs, which shows better performance than five state-of-the-art methods.

AB The upcoming fifth generation (5G) of wireless networks is expected to lay a foundation of intelligent networks with the provision of some isolated artificial intelligence (AI) operations. However, fully intelligent network orchestration and management for providing innovative services will only be realized in Beyond 5G (B5G) networks. To this end, we envisage that the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks will be driven by on-demand self-reconfiguration to ensure a many-fold increase in the network performance and service types. The increasingly stringent performance requirements of emerging networks may finally trigger the deployment of some interesting new technologies, such as large intelligent surfaces, electromagnetic-orbital angular momentum, visible light communications, and cell-free communications, to name a few. Our vision for 6G is a massively connected complex network capable of rapidly responding to the users' service calls through real-time learning of the network state as described by the network edge (e.g., base-station locations and cache contents), air interface (e.g., radio spectrum and propagation channel), and the user-side (e.g., battery-life and locations). The multi-state, multi-dimensional nature of the network state, requiring the real-time knowledge, can be viewed as a quantum uncertainty problem. In this regard, the emerging paradigms of machine learning (ML), quantum computing (QC), and quantum ML (QML) and their synergies with communication networks can be considered as core 6G enablers. Considering these potentials, starting with the 5G target services and enabling technologies, we provide a comprehensive review of the related state of the art in the domains of ML (including deep learning), QC, and QML and identify their potential benefits, issues, and use cases for their applications in the B5G networks. Subsequently, we propose a novel QC-assisted and QML-based framework for 6G communication networks while articulating its challenges and potential enabling technologies at the network infrastructure, network edge, air interface, and user end. Finally, some promising future research directions for the quantum-and QML-assisted B5G networks are identified and discussed.

AB Supply chain risk management (SCRM) encompasses a wide variety of strategies aiming to identify, assess, mitigate and monitor unexpected events or conditions which might have an impact, mostly adverse, on any part of a supply chain. SCRM strategies often depend on rapid and adaptive decision-making based on potentially large, multidimensional data sources. These characteristics make SCRM a suitable application area for artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of supply chain literature that addresses problems relevant to SCRM using approaches that fall within the AI spectrum. To that end, an investigation is conducted on the various definitions and classifications of supply chain risk and related notions such as uncertainty. Then, a mapping study is performed to categorise existing literature according to the AI methodology used, ranging from mathematical programming to Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics, and the specific SCRM task they address (identification, assessment or response). Finally, a comprehensive analysis of each category is provided to identify missing aspects and unexplored areas and propose directions for future research at the confluence of SCRM and AI.

TI Identifying enhancer-promoter interactions with neural network based on
   pre-trained DNA vectors and attention mechanism
SO BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Motivation: Identification of enhancer-promoter interactions (EPIs) is of great significance to human development. However, experimental methods to identify EPIs cost too much in terms of time, manpower and money. Therefore, more and more research efforts are focused on developing computational methods to solve this problem. Unfortunately, most existing computational methods require a variety of genomic data, which are not always available, especially for a new cell line. Therefore, it limits the large-scale practical application of methods. As an alternative, computational methods using sequences only have great genome-scale application prospects.
   Results: In this article, we propose a new deep learning method, namely EPIVAN, that enables predicting long-range EPIs using only genomic sequences. To explore the key sequential characteristics, we first use pre-trained DNA vectors to encode enhancers and promoters; afterwards, we use one-dimensional convolution and gated recurrent unit to extract local and global features; lastly, attention mechanism is used to boost the contribution of key features, further improving the performance of EPIVAN. Benchmarking comparisons on six cell lines show that EPIVAN performs better than state-of-the-art predictors. Moreover, we build a general model, which has transfer ability and can be used to predict EPIs in various cell lines.

AB In this paper, a nonlinear fractional emerging telecommunication model with higher-order dispersive cubic-quintic is studied by using two recent computational schemes. This kind of model is arising in many applications such as machine learning and deep learning, cloud computing, data science, dense sensor network, artificial intelligence convergence, integration of Internet of Things, self-service IT for business users, self-powered data centers, and dense sensor networks (DSNs) that is used in the turbine blades monitoring and health monitoring. Two practical algorithms (modified Khater method and sech-tanh functions method) are applied to higher-order dispersive cubic-quintic nonlinear complex fractional Schrodinger (NLCFS) equation. Many novel traveling wave solutions are constructed that do not exist earlier. These solutions are considered as the icon key in the emerging telecommunication field, were they able to explain the physical nature of the waves spread, especially in the dispersive medium. For more illustration, some attractive sketches are also depicted for the interpretation physically of the achieved solutions. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB This study investigates a 3D and fully convolutional neural network (CNN) for subcortical brain structure segmentation in MRI. 3D CNN architectures have been generally avoided due to their computational and memory requirements during inference. We address the problem via small kernels, allowing deeper architectures. We further model both local and global context by embedding intermediate-layer outputs in the final prediction, which encourages consistency between features extracted at different scales and embeds fine-grained information directly in the segmentation process. Our model is efficiently trained end-to-end on a graphics processing unit (GPU), in a single stage, exploiting the dense inference capabilities of fully CNNs.
   We performed comprehensive experiments over two publicly available datasets. First, we demonstrate a state-of-the-art performance on the ISBR dataset. Then, we report a large-scale multi-site evaluation over 1112 unregistered subject datasets acquired from 17 different sites (ABIDE dataset), with ages ranging from 7 to 64 years, showing that our method is robust to various acquisition protocols, demographics and clinical factors. Our method yielded segmentations that are highly consistent with a standard atlas-based approach, while running in a fraction of the time needed by atlas-based methods and avoiding registration/normalization steps. This makes it convenient for massive multi-site neuroanatomical imaging studies. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to study subcortical structure segmentation on such large-scale and heterogeneous data.

AB Purpose: To develop and evaluate a fully automated algorithm for segmenting the abdomen from CT to quantify body composition.
   Materials and Methods: For this retrospective study, a convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture was trained to perform abdominal segmentation on a data set of 2430 two-dimensional CT examinations and was tested on 270 CT examinations. It was further tested on a separate data set of 2369 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). CT examinations were performed between 1997 and 2015. The mean age of patients was 67 years; for male patients, it was 67 years (range, 2994 years), and for female patients, it was 66 years (range, 3197 years). Differences in segmentation performance were assessed by using two-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction.
   Results: Compared with reference segmentation, the model for this study achieved Dice scores (mean +/- standard deviation) of 0.98 +/- 0.03, 0.96 +/- 0.02, and 0.97 +/- 0.01 in the test set, and 0.94 +/- 0.05, 0.92 +/- 0.04, and 0.98 +/- 0.02 in the HCC data set, for the subcutaneous, muscle, and visceral adipose tissue compartments, respectively. Performance met or exceeded that of expert manual segmentation.
   Conclusion: Model performance met or exceeded the accuracy of expert manual segmentation of CT examinations for both the test data set and the hepatocellular carcinoma data set. The model generalized well to multiple levels of the abdomen and may be capable of fully automated quantification of body composition metrics in three-dimensional CT examinations. (c) RSNA, 2018

AB The discovery of newmaterials can bring enormous societal and technological progress. In this context, exploring completely the large space of potential materials is computationally intractable. Here, we review methods for achieving inverse design, which aims to discover tailored materials from the starting point of a particular desired functionality. Recent advances from the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence, mostly from the subfield of machine learning, have resulted in a fertile exchange of ideas, where approaches to inverse molecular design are being proposed and employed at a rapid pace. Among these, deep generativemodels have been applied to numerous classes of materials: rational design of prospective drugs, synthetic routes to organic compounds, and optimization of photovoltaics and redox flow batteries, as well as a variety of other solid-state materials.

AB The advent of computed tomography (CT) has revolutionized radiology, and this revolution is still going on. Starting as a pure head scanner, modern CT systems are now able to perform whole-body examinations within a couple of seconds in isotropic resolution, single-rotation whole-organ perfusion, and temporal resolution to fulfill the needs of cardiac CT. Because of the increasing number of CT examinations in all age groups and overall medical-driven radiation exposure, dose reduction remains a hot topic. Although fast gantry rotation, broad detector arrays, and different dual-energy solutions were main topics in the past years, new techniques such as photon counting detectors, powerful x-ray tubes for low-kV scanning, automated image preprocessing, and machine learning algorithms have moved into focus today. The aim of this article is to give an overview of the technical specifications of up-to-date available CT systems and recent hardware and software innovations for CT systems in the near future.

AB Modern companies generate value by digitalizing their services and products. Knowing what customers are saying about the firm through reviews in social media content constitutes a key factor to succeed in the big data era. However, social media data analysis is a complex discipline due to the subjectivity in text review and the additional features in raw data. Some frameworks proposed in the existing literature involve many steps that thereby increase their complexity. A two-stage framework to tackle this problem is proposed: the first stage is focused on data preparation and finding an optimal machine learning model for this data; the second stage relies on established layers of big data architectures focused on getting an outcome of data by taking most of the machine learning model of stage one. Thus, a first stage is proposed to analyze big and small datasets in a non-big data environment, whereas the second stage analyzes big datasets by applying the first stage machine learning model of. Then, a study case is presented for the first stage of the framework to analyze reviews of hotel-related businesses. Several machine learning algorithms were trained for two, three and five classes, with the best results being found for binary classification.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning and blockchain-based energy framework for smart grids, entitled DeepCoin. The DeepCoin framework uses two schemes, a blockchain-based scheme and a deep learning-based scheme. The blockchain-based scheme consists of five phases: setup phase, agreement phase, creating a block phase and consensus-making phase, and view change phase. It incorporates a novel reliable peer-to-peer energy system that is based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm and it achieves high throughput. In order to prevent smart grid attacks, the proposed framework makes the generation of blocks using short signatures and hash functions. The proposed deep learning-based scheme is an intrusion detection system (IDS), which employs recurrent neural networks for detecting network attacks and fraudulent transactions in the blockchain-based energy network. We study the performance of the proposed IDS on three different sources the CICIDS2017 dataset, a power system dataset, and a web robot (Bot)-Internet of Things (IoT) dataset.

AB Modeling visual attention-particularly stimulus-driven, saliency-based attention-has been a very active research area over the past 25 years. Many different models of attention are now available which, aside from lending theoretical contributions to other fields, have demonstrated successful applications in computer vision, mobile robotics, and cognitive systems. Here we review, from a computational perspective, the basic concepts of attention implemented in these models. We present a taxonomy of nearly 65 models, which provides a critical comparison of approaches, their capabilities, and shortcomings. In particular, 13 criteria derived from behavioral and computational studies are formulated for qualitative comparison of attention models. Furthermore, we address several challenging issues with models, including biological plausibility of the computations, correlation with eye movement datasets, bottom-up and top-down dissociation, and constructing meaningful performance measures. Finally, we highlight current research trends in attention modeling and provide insights for future.

AB Enzyme engineering plays a central role in developing efficient biocatalysts for biotechnology, biomedicine, and life sciences. Apart from classical rational design and directed evolution approaches, machine learning methods have been increasingly applied to find patterns in data that help predict protein structures, improve enzyme stability, solubility, and function, predict substrate specificity, and guide rational protein design. In this Perspective, we analyze the state of the art in databases and methods used for training and validating predictors in enzyme engineering. We discuss current limitations and challenges which the community is facing and recent advancements in experimental and theoretical methods that have the potential to address those challenges. We also present our view on possible future directions for developing the applications to the design of efficient biocatalysts.

ID SHAPE
AB The paper introduces Hough forests, which are random forests adapted to perform a generalized Hough transform in an efficient way. Compared to previous Hough-based systems such as implicit shape models, Hough forests improve the performance of the generalized Hough transform for object detection on a categorical level. At the same time, their flexibility permits extensions of the Hough transform to new domains such as object tracking and action recognition. Hough forests can be regarded as task-adapted codebooks of local appearance that allow fast supervised training and fast matching at test time. They achieve high detection accuracy since the entries of such codebooks are optimized to cast Hough votes with small variance and since their efficiency permits dense sampling of local image patches or video cuboids during detection. The efficacy of Hough forests for a set of computer vision tasks is validated through experiments on a large set of publicly available benchmark data sets and comparisons with the state-of-the-art.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Salient object detection from RGB-D images is an important yet challenging vision task, which aims at detecting the most distinctive objects in a scene by combining color information and depth constraints. Unlike prior fusion manners, we propose an attention steered interweave fusion network (ASIF-Net) to detect salient objects, which progressively integrates cross-modal and cross-level complementarity from the RGB image and corresponding depth map via steering of an attention mechanism. Specifically, the complementary features from RGB-D images are jointly extracted and hierarchically fused in a dense and interweaved manner. Such a manner breaks down the barriers of inconsistency existing in the cross-modal data and also sufficiently captures the complementarity. Meanwhile, an attention mechanism is introduced to locate the potential salient regions in an attention-weighted fashion, which advances in highlighting the salient objects and suppressing the cluttered background regions. Instead of focusing only on pixelwise saliency, we also ensure that the detected salient objects have the objectness characteristics (e.g., complete structure and sharp boundary) by incorporating the adversarial learning that provides a global semantic constraint for RGB-D salient object detection. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against 17 state-of-the-art saliency detectors on four publicly available RGB-D salient object detection datasets. The code and results of our method are available at https://github.com/Li-Chongyi/ASIF-Net.

AB Many reduced-order models are neither robust with respect to parameter changes nor cost-effective enough for handling the nonlinear dependence of complex dynamical systems. In this study, we put forth a robust machine learning framework for projection-based reduced-order modeling of such nonlinear and nonstationary systems. As a demonstration, we focus on a nonlinear advection-diffusion system given by the viscous Burgers equation, which is a prototypical setting of more realistic fluid dynamics applications due to its quadratic nonlinearity. In our proposed methodology the effects of truncated modes are modeled using a single layer feed-forward neural network architecture. The neural network architecture is trained by utilizing both the Bayesian regularization and extreme learning machine approaches, where the latter one is found to be more computationally efficient. A significant emphasis is laid on the selection of basis functions through the use of both Fourier bases and proper orthogonal decomposition. It is shown that the proposed model yields significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Galerkin projection methodology with a negligibly small computational overhead and provide reliable predictions with respect to parameter changes.

ID MODULATED SIGNALS
AB This paper looks into the modulation classification problem for a distributed wireless spectrum sensing network. First, a new data-driven model for automatic modulation classification based on long short term memory (LSTM) is proposed. The model learns from the time domain amplitude and phase information of the modulation schemes present in the training data without requiring expert features like higher order cyclic moments. Analyses show that the proposed model yields an average classification accuracy of close to 90% at varying signal-to-noise ratio conditions ranging from 0 dB to 20 dB. Further, we explore the utility of this LSTM model for a variable symbol rate scenario. We show that a LSTM based model can learn good representations of variable length time domain sequences, which is useful in classifying modulation signals with different symbol rates. The achieved accuracy of 75% on an input sample length of 64 for which it was not trained, substantiates the representation power of the model. To reduce the data communication overhead from distributed sensors, the feasibility of classification using averaged magnitude spectrum data and on-line classification on the low-cost spectrum sensors are studied. Furthermore, quantized realizations of the proposed models are analyzed for deployment on sensors with low processing power.

AB The intermittent nature associated with photovoltaic (PV) generation is a challenging problem for the optimal planning and efficient management in smart grids. A reliable forecasting model of solar irradiance can play an essential role in allowing high PV penetrations without degrading the grid performance. For this purpose, most related works either use individual forecasting models or ensemble approaches (e.g., weighted average), ignoring the interaction between the values to be aggregated and thus may worsen the forecasting reliability. Differently, in this article, we propose a reliable solar irradiance forecasting method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) models and an aggregation function based on Choquet integral. This novel combination has the following features: 1) LSTM models can achieve accurate predictions because they model the temporal changes in solar irradiance, thanks to their recurrent architecture and memory units, and 2) the Choquet integral can model the interaction between the inputs to be aggregated through a fuzzy measure. This aggregation technique can determine the largest consistency among the conflicting forecasting results, taking advantage of each individual model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we compare it with several forecasting methods using six realistic datasets collected from different sites in Finland in which solar irradiance is intermittent. The comparison reveals the high reliability of the proposed forecasting model with different sites and solar profiles.

AB The computer vision and pattern recognition communities have recently witnessed a surge of feature-based methods in object recognition and image retrieval applications. These methods allow representing images as collections of "visual words" and treat them using text search approaches following the "bag of features" paradigm. In this article, we explore analogous approaches in the 3D world applied to the problem of nonrigid shape retrieval in large databases. Using multiscale diffusion heat kernels as "geometric words," we construct compact and informative shape descriptors by means of the " bag of features" approach. We also show that considering pairs of " geometric words" ("geometric expressions") allows creating spatially sensitive bags of features with better discriminative power. Finally, adopting metric learning approaches, we show that shapes can be efficiently represented as binary codes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the SHREC 2010 large-scale shape retrieval benchmark.

AB With the slowing down of the Moore's law and fundamental limitations due to the von-Neumann bottleneck, continued improvements in computing hardware performance become increasingly more challenging. Resistive switching (RS) devices are being extensively studied as promising candidates for next generation memory and computing applications due to their fast switching speed, excellent endurance and retention, and scaling and three-dimensional (3D) stacking capability. In particular, RS devices offer the potential to natively emulate the functions and structures of synapses and neurons, allowing them to efficiently implement neural networks (NNs) and other in-memory computing systems for data intensive applications such as machine learning tasks. In this review, we will examine the mechanisms of RS effects and discuss recent progresses in the application of RS devices for memory, deep learning accelerator, and more faithful brain-inspired computing tasks. Challenges and possible solutions at the device, algorithm, and system levels will also be discussed.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Narrow-band imaging is an image-enhanced form of endoscopy used to observed microstructures and capillaries of the mucosal epithelium which allows for real-time prediction of histologic features of colorectal polyps. However, narrow-band imaging expertise is required to differentiate hyperplastic from neoplastic polyps with high levels of accuracy. We developed and tested a system of computer-aided diagnosis with a deep neural network (DNN-CAD) to analyze narrow-band images of diminutive colorectal polyps. METHODS: We collected 1476 images of neoplastic polyps and 681 images of hyperplastic polyps, obtained from the picture archiving and communications system database in a tertiary hospital in Taiwan. Histologic findings from the polyps were also collected and used as the reference standard. The images and data were used to train the DNN. A test set of images (96 hyperplastic and 188 neoplastic polyps, smaller than 5 mm), obtained from patients who underwent colonoscopies from March 2017 through August 2017, was then used to test the diagnostic ability of the DNN-CAD vs endoscopists (2 expert and 4 novice), who were asked to classify the images of the test set as neoplastic or hyperplastic. Their classifications were compared with findings from histologic analysis. The primary outcome measures were diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic time. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic time were compared among DNN-CAD, the novice endoscopists, and the expert endoscopists. The study was designed to detect a difference of 10% in accuracy by a 2-sided McNemar test. RESULTS: In the test set, the DNN-CAD identified neoplastic or hyperplastic polyps with 96.3% sensitivity, 78.1% specificity, a PPV of 89.6%, and a NPV of 91.5%. Fewer than half of the novice endoscopists classified polyps with a NPV of 90% (their NPVs ranged from 73.9% to 84.0%). DNN-CAD classified polyps as neoplastic or hyperplastic in 0.45 +/- 0.07 seconds-shorter than the time required by experts (1.54 +/- 1.30 seconds) and nonexperts (1.77 +/- 1.37 seconds) (both P < .001). DNN-CAD classified polyps with perfect intra-observer agreement (kappa score of 1). There was a low level of intra-observer and inter-observer agreement in classification among endoscopists. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a system called DNN-CAD to identify neoplastic or hyperplastic colorectal polyps less than 5 mm. The system classified polyps with a PPV of 89.6%, and a NPV of 91.5%, and in a shorter time than endoscopists. This deep-learning model has potential for not only endoscopic image recognition but for other forms of medical image analysis, including sonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance images.

AB Advances in personalization algorithms and other applications of machine learning have vastly enhanced the ease and convenience of our media and communication experiences, but they have also raised significant concerns about privacy, transparency of technologies and human control over their operations. Going forth, reconciling such tensions between machine agency and human agency will be important in the era of artificial intelligence (AI), as machines get more agentic and media experiences become increasingly determined by algorithms. Theory and research should be geared toward a deeper understanding of the human experience of algorithms in general and the psychology of Human-AI interaction (HAII) in particular. This article proposes some directions by applying the dual-process framework of the Theory of Interactive Media Effects (TIME) for studying the symbolic and enabling effects of the affordances of AI-driven media on user perceptions and experiences.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL
AB As a breakthrough in the field of machine fault diagnosis, deep learning has great potential to extract more abstract and discriminative features automatically without much prior knowledge compared with other methods, such as the signal processing and analysis-based methods and machine learning methods with shallow architectures. One of the most important aspects in measuring the extracted features is whether they can explore more information of the inputs and avoid redundancy to be representative. Thus, a stacked sparse autoencoder (SAE)-based machine fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper. The penalty term of the SAE can help mine essential information and avoid redundancy. To help the constructed diagnosis network further mine more abstract and representative high-level features, the collected non-stationary and transient signals are preprocessed with ensemble empirical mode decomposition and autoregressive (AR) models to obtain AR parameters, which are extracted based on the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and regarded as the low-level features for the inputs of the proposed diagnosis network. Only the first four IMFs are considered, because fault information is mainly refiected in high-frequency IMFs. Experiments and comparisons are complemented to validate the superiority of the presented diagnosis network. Results fully demonstrate that the stacked SAE-based diagnosis method can extract more discriminative high-level features and has a better performance in rotating machinery fault diagnosis compared with the traditional machine learning methods with shallow architectures.

AB This study aims to take into account the feasibility of three ensemble machine learning algorithms for predicting blast-induced air over-pressure (AOp) in open-pit mine, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), and Cubist. An empirical technique was also applied to predict AOp and compared with those of the ensemble models. To employ this study, 146 events of blast were investigated with 80% of the total database (approximately 118 blasting events) being used for developing the models, whereas the rest (20% 28 blasts) were used to validate the models' accuracy. RMSE, MAE, and R-2 were used as performance indices for evaluating the reliability of the models. The findings revealed that the ensemble models yielded more precise accuracy than those of the empirical model. Of the ensemble models, the Cubist model provided better performance than those of RF and GBM models with RMSE, MAE, and R-2 of 2.483, 0.976, and 0.956, respectively, whereas the RF and GBM models provided poorer accuracy with an RMSE of 2.579, 2.721; R-2 of 0.953, 0.950, and MAE of 1.103, 1.498, respectively. In contrast, the empirical model was interpreted as the poorest model with an RMSE of 4.448, R-2 of 0.872, and MAE of 3.719. In addition, other findings indicated that explosive charge capacity, spacing, stemming, monitoring distance, and air humidity were the most important inputs for the AOp predictive models using artificial intelligence.

AB Machine learning (ML) encompasses statistical methods that learn to identify patterns in complex datasets. Here, I review application areas in plant-pathogen interactions that have recently benefited from ML, such as disease monitoring, the discovery of gene regulatory networks, genomic selection for disease resistance and prediction of pathogen effectors. However, achieving robust performance from ML is not trivial and requires knowledge of both the methodology and the biology. I discuss common pitfalls and challenges in using ML approaches. Finally, I highlight future opportunities for ML as a tool for dissecting plant-pathogen interactions using high-throughput data, for example, through integration of diverse data sources and the analysis with higher resolution, such as from individual cells or on elaborate spatial and temporal scales.

AB There is a growing need to increase global crop yields, whilst minimising use of resources such as land, fertilisers and water. Agricultural researchers use ground-based observations to identify, select and develop crops with favourable genotypes and phenotypes; however, the ability to collect rapid, high quality and high volume phenotypic data in open fields is restricting this. This study develops and assesses a method for deriving crop height and growth rate rapidly from multi-temporal, very high spatial resolution (1 cm/pixel), 3D digital surface models of crop field trials produced via Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry using aerial imagery collected through repeated campaigns flying an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a mounted Red Green Blue (RGB) camera. We compare UAV SfM modelled crop heights to those derived from terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and to the standard field measurement of crop height conducted using a 2 m rule. The most accurate UAV-derived surface model and the TLS both achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.03 m compared to the existing manual 2 m rule method. The optimised UAV method was then applied to the growing season of a winter wheat field phenotyping experiment containing 25 different varieties grown in 27 m(2) plots and subject to four different nitrogen fertiliser treatments. Accuracy assessments at different stages of crop growth produced consistently low RMSE values (0.07, 0.02 and 0.03 m for May, June and July, respectively), enabling crop growth rate to be derived from differencing of the multi-temporal surface models. We find growth rates range from -13 mm/day to 17 mm/day. Our results clearly display the impact of variable nitrogen fertiliser rates on crop growth. Digital surface models produced provide a novel spatial mapping of crop height variation both at the field scale and also within individual plots. This study proves UAV based SfM has the potential to become a new standard for high-throughput phenotyping of in-field crop heights.

AB In this study, we present a flexible, cost-effective, and accurate method to monitor landslides using a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to collect aerial photography. In the first part, we apply a Structure from Motion (SfM) workflow to derive a 3D model of a landslide in southeast Tasmania from multi-view UAV photography. The geometric accuracy of the 3D model and resulting DEMs and orthophoto mosaics was tested with ground control points coordinated with geodetic GPS receivers. A horizontal accuracy of 7 cm and vertical accuracy of 6 cm was achieved. In the second part, two DEMs and orthophoto mosaics acquired on 16 July 2011 and 10 November 2011 were compared to study landslide dynamics. The COSI-Corr image correlation technique was evaluated to quantify and map terrain displacements. The magnitude and direction of the displacement vectors derived from correlating two hillshaded DEM layers corresponded to a visual interpretation of landslide change. Results show that the algorithm can accurately map displacements of the toes, chunks of soil, and vegetation patches on top of the landslide, but is not capable of mapping the retreat of the main scarp. The conclusion is that UAV-based imagery in combination with 3D scene reconstruction and image correlation algorithms provide flexible and effective tools to map and monitor landslide dynamics.

AB Landslide is a common natural hazard and responsible for extensive damage and losses in mountainous areas. In this study, Longju in the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China was taken as a case study for landslide susceptibility assessment in order to develop effective risk prevention and mitigation strategies. To begin, 202 landslides were identified, including 95 colluvial landslides and 107 rockfalls. Twelve landslide causal factor maps were prepared initially, and the relationship between these factors and each landslide type was analyzed using the information value model. Later, the unimportant factors were selected and eliminated using the information gain ratio technique. The landslide locations were randomly divided into two groups: 70% for training and 30% for verifying. Two machine learning models: the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), and a multivariate statistical model: the logistic regression (LR), were applied for landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM) for each type. The LSM index maps, obtained from combining the assessment results of the two landslide types, were classified into five levels. The performance of the LSMs was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristics curve and Friedman test. Results show that the elimination of noise-generating factors and the separated modeling of each landslide type have significantly increased the prediction accuracy. The machine learning models outperformed the multivariate statistical model and SVM model was found ideal for the case study area.

AB With the increasing threat of recurring landslides, susceptibility maps are expected to play a bigger role in promoting our understanding of future landslides and their magnitude. This study describes the development and validation of a spatially explicit deep learning (DL) neural network model for the prediction of landslide susceptibility. A geospatial database was generated based on 217 landslide events from the Muong Lay district (Vietnam), for which a suite of nine landslide conditioning factors was derived. The Relief-F feature selection method was employed to quantify the utility of the conditioning factors for developing the landslide predictive model. Several performance metrics demonstrated that the DL model performed well both in terms of the goodness-of-fit with the training dataset (AUC = 0.90; accuracy = 82%; RMSE = 0.36) and the ability to predict future landslides (AUC = 0.89; accuracy = 82%; RMSE = 0.38). The efficiency of the model was compared to the quadratic discriminant analysis, Fisher's linear discriminant analysis, and multi-layer perceptron neural network. A comparative analysis using the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed a significant improvement of landslide prediction using the spatially explicit DL model over these other models. The insights provided from this study will be valuable for further development of landslide predictive models and spatially explicit assessment of landslide-prone regions around the world.

AB Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is an active and important research task driven by many practical applications. To leverage deep learning models especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for HSI classification, this paper proposes a simple yet effective method to extract hierarchical deep spatial feature for HSI classification by exploring the power of off-the-shelf CNN models, without any additional retraining or fine-tuning on the target data set. To obtain better classification accuracy, we further propose a unified metric learning-based framework to alternately learn discriminative spectral-spatial features, which have better representation capability and train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. To this end, we design a new objective function that explicitly embeds a metric learning regularization term into SVM training. The metric learning regularization term is used to learn a powerful spectral-spatial feature representation by fusing spectral feature and deep spatial feature, which has small intraclass scatter but big between class separation. By transforming HSI data into new spectral-spatial feature space through CNN and metric learning, we can pull the pixels from the same class closer, while pushing the different class pixels farther away. In the experiments, we comprehensively evaluate the proposed method on three commonly used HSI benchmark data sets. State-of-the-art results are achieved when compared with the existing HSI classification methods.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to garter substantial interest in medical imaging. The potential applications are vast and include the entirety of the. medical imaging life cycle from image exertion to diagnosis to outcome prediction. The chief obstacles to development and clinical implementation of AI algorithms include availability of sufficiently large, curated, and representative training data that includes expert labeling (eg, annotations). Current supervised AI methods require a curation proem for data to optimally train, validate, and test algorithms. Currently, most and research group industry have limited data access based on small sample sizes from small geographic areas. In addition, die preparation of data is a costly and time-intensive process, the results of which ate algorithms with limited utility and poor generalization. In this article, the authors describe fundamental steps for preparing medical imaging data in AI algorithm development, explain current limitations to data curation, and explore new approaches to address the problem of data availability.

AB Making an accurate diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) disease is a challenging task that involves many parties such as radiology specialists often times need to delineate NPC boundaries on various tumor-bearing endoscopic images. It is a tedious and time-consuming operation exceedingly based on doctors and experience of radiologist. NPC has complex and irregular structures which makes it difficult to diagnose even by an expert physician. However, the diagnosis accuracy results of such methods are still insignificant and need improvement in order to manifest robust solution. The study aim is to develop and propose a new automatic classification of NPC tumor using machine learning techniques and feature-based decision-level fusion scheme from endoscopic images. We have implemented the fusion of the three image texture-based schemes (local binary patterns, the first-order statistics histogram properties, and histogram of gray scale) at the decision level and tested the performance of this scheme using the same experimental setup in the previous section for simple score-level fusion, but for comparison, We used the classifiers methods which are support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors' algorithm, and artificial neural network (ANN). The results demonstrate that the majority rule for decision-based fusion is outperformed considerably by the single best performing feature scheme (FFGF) for the SVM classifier, but for the ANN and KNN classifier it is significantly outperformed by each of the components features. The classifiers approaches were listed a high accuracy of 94.07%, the sensitivity of 92.05%, and specificity of 93.07%.

AB Plant diseases affect the growth of their respective species, therefore their early identification is very important. Many Machine Learning (ML) models have been employed for the detection and classification of plant diseases but, after the advancements in a subset of ML, that is, Deep Learning (DL), this area of research appears to have great potential in terms of increased accuracy. Many developed/modified DL architectures are implemented along with several visualization techniques to detect and classify the symptoms of plant diseases. Moreover, several performance metrics are used for the evaluation of these architectures/techniques. This review provides a comprehensive explanation of DL models used to visualize various plant diseases. In addition, some research gaps are identified from which to obtain greater transparency for detecting diseases in plants, even before their symptoms appear clearly.

AB Rapid and uncontrolled population growth along with economic and industrial development, especially in developing countries during the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, have increased the rate of land-use/land-cover (LULC) change many times. Since quantitative assessment of changes in LULC is one of the most efficient means to understand and manage the land transformation, there is a need to examine the accuracy of different algorithms for LULC mapping in order to identify the best classifier for further applications of earth observations. In this article, six machine-learning algorithms, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), fuzzy adaptive resonance theory-supervised predictive mapping (Fuzzy ARTMAP), spectral angle mapper (SAM) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) were examined. Accuracy assessment was performed by using Kappa coefficient, receiver operational curve (RoC), index-based validation and root mean square error (RMSE). Results of Kappa coefficient show that all the classifiers have a similar accuracy level with minor variation, but the RF algorithm has the highest accuracy of 0.89 and the MD algorithm (parametric classifier) has the least accuracy of 0.82. In addition, the index-based LULC and visual cross-validation show that the RF algorithm (correlations between RF and normalised differentiation water index, normalised differentiation vegetation index and normalised differentiation built-up index are 0.96, 0.99 and 1, respectively, at 0.05 level of significance) has the highest accuracy level in comparison to the other classifiers adopted. Findings from the literature also proved that ANN and RF algorithms are the best LULC classifiers, although a non-parametric classifier like SAM (Kappa coefficient 0.84; area under curve (AUC) 0.85) has a better and consistent accuracy level than the other machine-learning algorithms. Finally, this review concludes that the RF algorithm is the best machine-learning LULC classifier, among the six examined algorithms although it is necessary to further test the RF algorithm in different morphoclimatic conditions in the future.

Our method consists of the following stages: a randomized decision forest classifier for image segmentation, a robust method for labeled dataset generation, a convolutional network for dense feature extraction, and finally an inverse kinematics stage for stable real-time pose recovery. As one possible application of this pipeline, we show state-of-the-art results for real-time puppeteering of a skinned hand-model.

AB Using Instagram data from 166 individuals, we applied machine learning tools to successfully identify markers of depression. Statistical features were computationally extracted from 43,950 participant Instagram photos, using color analysis, metadata components, and algorithmic face detection. Resulting models outperformed general practitioners' average unassisted diagnostic success rate for depression. These results held even when the analysis was restricted to posts made before depressed individuals were first diagnosed. Human ratings of photo attributes (happy, sad, etc.) were weaker predictors of depression, and were uncorrelated with computationally-generated features. These results suggest new avenues for early screening and detection of mental illness.

AB The fast and robust automated quality visual inspection has received increasing attention in the product quality control for production efficiency. To effectively detect defects in products, many methods focus on the hand-crafted optical features. However, these methods tend to only work well under specified conditions and have many requirements for the input. So the work in this paper targets on building a deep model to solve this problem. The elaborately designed deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) proposed by us can automatically extract powerful features with less prior knowledge about the images for defect detection, while at the same time is robust to noise. We experimentally evaluate this CNN model on a benchmark dataset and achieve a fast detection result with a high accuracy, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods.

AB With the increasing demand of location-based services, Wi-Fi based localization has attracted great interest because it provides ubiquitous access in indoor environments. In this paper, we propose CiFi, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for indoor localization with commodity 5GHz WiFi. Leveraging a modified device driver, we extract phase data of channel state information (CSI), which is used to estimate the angle of arrival (AoA). We then create estimated AoA images as input to a DCNN, to train the weights in the offline phase. The location of mobile device is predicted based using the trained DCNN and new CSI AoA images. We implement the proposed CiFi system with commodity Wi-Fi devices in the 5GHz band and verify its performance with extensive experiments in two representative indoor environments.

AB In this paper, we present new models and algorithms for object-level video advertising. A framework that aims to embed content-relevant ads within a video stream is investigated in this context. First, a comprehensive optimization model is designed to minimize intrusiveness to viewers when ads are inserted in a video. For human clothing advertising, we design a deep convolutional neural network using face features to recognize human genders in a video stream. Human parts alignment is then implemented to extract human part features that are used for clothing retrieval. Second, we develop a heuristic algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem. For comparison, we also employ the genetic algorithm to find solutions approaching the global optimum. Our novel framework is examined in various types of videos. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for object-level video advertising.

AB The need for accurate modeling of the rainfall-runoff process has grown rapidly in the past decades. However, considering the high stochastic property of the process, many models are still being developed in order to define such a complex phenomenon. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the Adaptive Neural-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) have been extensively used by hydrologists for rainfall-runoff modeling as well as for other fields of hydrology.
   In this paper, two hybrid AI-based models which are reliable in capturing the periodicity features of the process are introduced for watershed rainfall-runoff modeling. In the first model, the SARIMAX (Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous input)-ANN model, an ANN is used to find the non-linear relationship among the residuals of the fitted linear SARIMAX model. In the second model, the wavelet-ANFIS model, wavelet transform is linked to the ANFIS concept and the main time series of two variables (rainfall and runoff) are decomposed into some multi-frequency time series by wavelet transform. Afterwards, these time series are imposed as input data to the ANFIS to predict the runoff discharge one time step ahead. The obtained results of the models applications for the rainfall-runoff modeling of two watersheds (located in Azerbaijan, Iran) show that, although the proposed models can predict both short and long terms runoff discharges by considering seasonality effects, the second model is relatively more appropriate because it uses the multi-scale time series of rainfall and runoff data in the ANFIS input layer.

AB In medical field, it remains challenging to accurately segment medical images due to low contrast, complex noises and intensity inhomogeneity. To overcome these obstacles, this paper provides a novel edge-based active contour model (ACM) for medical image segmentation. Specifically, an accurate regularization approach is presented to maintain the level set function with a signed distance property, which guarantees the stability of the evolution curve and the accuracy of the numerical computation. More significantly, an adaptive perturbation is integrated into the framework of the edge-based ACM. The perturbation technique can balance the stability of curve evolution and the accuracy of segmentation, which is key for segmenting medical images with intensity inhomogeneity. A number of experiments on both artificial and real medical images demonstrate that the proposed segmentation model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness to noise and segmentation accuracy.

   R-CNN; YOLOv2-reduced; high performance computing
AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has been used as a promising data source for monitoring maritime activities, and its application for oil and ship detection has been the focus of many previous research studies. Many object detection methods ranging from traditional to deep learning approaches have been proposed. However, majority of them are computationally intensive and have accuracy problems. The huge volume of the remote sensing data also brings a challenge for real time object detection. To mitigate this problem a high performance computing (HPC) method has been proposed to accelerate SAR imagery analysis, utilizing the GPU based computing methods. In this paper, we propose an enhanced GPU based deep learning method to detect ship from the SAR images. The You Only Look Once version 2 (YOLOv2) deep learning framework is proposed to model the architecture and training the model. YOLOv2 is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system, which outperforms Faster Region-Based Convolutional Network (Faster R-CNN) and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) methods. Additionally, in order to reduce computational time with relatively competitive detection accuracy, we develop a new architecture with less number of layers called YOLOv2-reduced. In the experiment, we use two types of datasets: A SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) dataset and a Diversified SAR Ship Detection Dataset (DSSDD). These two datasets were used for training and testing purposes. YOLOv2 test results showed an increase in accuracy of ship detection as well as a noticeable reduction in computational time compared to Faster R-CNN. From the experimental results, the proposed YOLOv2 architecture achieves an accuracy of 90.05% and 89.13% on the SSDD and DSSDD datasets respectively. The proposed YOLOv2-reduced architecture has a similarly competent detection performance as YOLOv2, but with less computational time on a NVIDIA TITAN X GPU. The experimental results shows that the deep learning can make a big leap forward in improving the performance of SAR image ship detection.

The system is based on a supervised statistical text classification approach leveraging a variety of surface-form, semantic, and sentiment features. The sentiment features are primarily derived from novel high-coverage tweet-specific sentiment lexicons. These lexicons are automatically generated from tweets with sentiment-word hashtags and from tweets with emoticons. To adequately capture the sentiment of words in negated contexts, a separate sentiment lexicon is generated for negated words.
   The system ranked first in the SemEval-2013 shared task 'Sentiment Analysis in Twitter' (Task 2), obtaining an F-score of 69.02 in the message-level task and 88.93 in the term-level task. Post-competition improvements boost the performance to an F-score of 70.45 (message-level task) and 89.50 (term-level task). The system also obtains state-of-the- art performance on two additional datasets: the SemEval-2013 SMS test set and a corpus of movie review excerpts. The ablation experiments demonstrate that the use of the automatically generated lexicons results in performance gains of up to 6.5 absolute percentage points.

AB Motivated by the increasing computational capacity of wireless user equipments (UEs), e.g., smart phones, tablets, or vehicles, as well as the increasing concerns about sharing private data, a new machine learning model has emerged, namely federated learning (FL), that allows a decoupling of data acquisition and computation at the central unit. Unlike centralized learning taking place in a data center, FL usually operates in a wireless edge network where the communication medium is resource-constrained and unreliable. Due to limited bandwidth, only a portion of UEs can be scheduled for updates at each iteration. Due to the shared nature of the wireless medium, transmissions are subjected to interference and are not guaranteed. The performance of FL system in such a setting is not well understood. In this paper, an analytical model is developed to characterize the performance of FL in wireless networks. Particularly, tractable expressions are derived for the convergence rate of FL in a wireless setting, accounting for effects from both scheduling schemes and inter-cell interference. Using the developed analysis, the effectiveness of three different scheduling policies, i.e., random scheduling (RS), round robin (RR), and proportional fair (PF), are compared in terms of FL convergence rate. It is shown that running FL with PF outperforms RS and RR if the network is operating under a high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold, while RR is more preferable when the SINR threshold is low. Moreover, the FL convergence rate decreases rapidly as the SINR threshold increases, thus confirming the importance of compression and quantization of the update parameters. The analysis also reveals a trade-off between the number of scheduled UEs and subchannel bandwidth under a fixed amount of available spectrum.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; PHYSICS
AB Artificial intelligence offers the potential to automate challenging dataprocessing tasks in collider physics. To establish its prospects, we explore to what extent deep learning with convolutional neural networks can discriminate quark and gluon jets better than observables designed by physicists. Our approach builds upon the paradigm that a jet can be treated as an image, with intensity given by the local calorimeter deposits. We supplement this construction by adding color to the images, with red, green and blue intensities given by the transverse momentum in charged particles, transverse momentum in neutral particles, and pixel-level charged particle counts. Overall, the deep networks match or outperform traditional jet variables. We also find that, while various simulations produce different quark and gluon jets, the neural networks are surprisingly insensitive to these differences, similar to traditional observables. This suggests that the networks can extract robust physical information from imperfect simulations.

AB Light field imaging has emerged as a technology allowing to capture richer visual information from our world. As opposed to traditional photography, which captures a 2D projection of the light in the scene integrating the angular domain, light fields collect radiance from rays in all directions, demultiplexing the angular information lost in conventional photography. On the one hand, this higher dimensional representation of visual data offers powerful capabilities for scene understanding, and substantially improves the performance of traditional computer vision problems such as depth sensing, post-capture refocusing, segmentation, video stabilization, material classification, etc. On the other hand, the high-dimensionality of light fields also brings up new challenges in terms of data capture, data compression, content editing, and display. Taking these two elements together, research in light field image processing has become increasingly popular in the computer vision, computer graphics, and signal processing communities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview and discussion of research in this field over the past 20 years. We focus on all aspects of light field image processing, including basic light field representation and theory, acquisition, super-resolution, depth estimation, compression, editing, processing algorithms for light field display, and computer vision applications of light field data.

AB Background: The ability to spontaneously attend to the social overtures and activities of others is essential for the development of social cognition and communication. This ability is critically impaired in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD); however, it is not clear if prodromal symptoms in this area are already present in the first year of life of those affected by the disorder.
   Methods: To examine whether 6-month-old infants later diagnosed with ASD exhibit atypical spontaneous social monitoring skills, visual responses of 67 infants at high-risk and 50 at low-risk for ASD were studied using an eye-tracking task. Based on their clinical presentation in the third year, infants were divided into those with ASD, those exhibiting atypical development, and those developing typically.
   Results: Compared with the control groups, 6-month-old infants later diagnosed with ASD attended less to the social scene, and when they did look at the scene, they spent less time monitoring the actress in general and her face in particular. Limited attention to the actress and her activities was not accompanied by enhanced attention to objects.
   Conclusions: Prodromal symptoms of ASD at 6 months include a diminished ability to attend spontaneously to people and their activities. A limited attentional bias toward people early in development is likely to have a detrimental impact on the specialization of social brain networks and the emergence of social interaction patterns. Further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and role in psychopathology of ASD in the first year is warranted.

AB In last few decades, human activity recognition grabbed considerable research attentions from a wide range of pattern recognition and human computer interaction researchers due to its prominent applications such as smart home health care. For instance, activity recognition systems can be adopted in a smart home health care system to improve their rehabilitation processes of patients. There are various ways of using different sensors for human activity recognition in a smartly controlled environment. Among which, physical human activity recognition through wearable sensors provides valuable information about an individual's degree of functional ability and lifestyle. In this paper, we present a smartphone inertial sensors-based approach for human activity recognition. Efficient features are first extracted from raw data. The features include mean, median, autoregressive coefficients, etc. The features are further processed by a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to make them more robust. Finally, the features are trained with a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for successful activity recognition. The proposed approach was compared with traditional expression recognition approaches such as typical multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) where it outperformed them.

AB Objective: This work aims to provide a review of the existing literature in the field of automated machine learning (AutoML) to help healthcare professionals better utilize machine learning models "off-the-shelf" with limited data science expertise. We also identify the potential opportunities and barriers to using AutoML in healthcare, as well as existing applications of AutoML in healthcare.
   Methods: Published papers, accompanied with code, describing work in the field of AutoML from both a computer science perspective or a biomedical informatics perspective were reviewed. We also provide a short summary of a series of AutoML challenges hosted by ChaLearn.
   Results: A review of 101 papers in the field of AutoML revealed that these automated techniques can match or improve upon expert human performance in certain machine learning tasks, often in a shorter amount of time. The main limitation of AutoML at this point is the ability to get these systems to work efficiently on a large scale, i.e. beyond small- and medium-size retrospective datasets.
   Discussion: The utilization of machine learning techniques has the demonstrated potential to improve health outcomes, cut healthcare costs, and advance clinical research. However, most hospitals are not currently deploying machine learning solutions. One reason for this is that health care professionals often lack the machine learning expertise that is necessary to build a successful model, deploy it in production, and integrate it with the clinical workflow. In order to make machine learning techniques easier to apply and to reduce the demand for human experts, automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a growing field that seeks to automatically select, compose, and parametrize machine learning models, so as to achieve optimal performance on a given task and/or dataset.
   Conclusion: While there have already been some use cases of AutoML in the healthcare field, more work needs to be done in order for there to be widespread adoption of AutoML in healthcare.

AB Previous studies have shown that spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can be used in spiking neural networks (SNN) to extract visual features of low or intermediate complexity in an unsupervised manner. These studies, however, used relatively shallow architectures, and only one layer was trainable. Another line of research has demonstrated-using rate-based neural networks trained with back-propagation that having many layers increases the recognition robustness, an approach known as deep learning. We thus designed a deep SNN, comprising several convolutional (trainable with STDP) and pooling layers. We used a temporal coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, and less activated neurons fire later or not at all. The network was exposed to natural images. Thanks to STDP, neurons progressively learned features corresponding to prototypical patterns that were both salient and frequent. Only a few tens of examples per category were required and no label was needed. After learning, the complexity of the extracted features increased along the hierarchy, from edge detectors in the first layer to object prototypes in the last layer. Coding was very sparse, with only a few thousands spikes per image, and in some cases the object category could be reasonably well inferred from the activity of a single higher-order neuron. More generally, the activity of a few hundreds of such neurons contained robust category information, as demonstrated using a classifier on Caltech 101, ETH-80, and MNIST databases. We also demonstrate the superiority of STDP over other unsupervised techniques such as random crops (HMAX) or auto-encoders. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of STDP with latency coding may be a key to understanding the way that the primate visual system learns, its remarkable processing speed and its low energy consumption. These mechanisms are also interesting for artificial vision systems, particularly for hardware solutions. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We propose CornerNet, a new approach to object detection where we detect an object bounding box as a pair of keypoints, the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner, using a single convolution neural network. By detecting objects as paired keypoints, we eliminate the need for designing a set of anchor boxes commonly used in prior single-stage detectors. In addition to our novel formulation, we introduce corner pooling, a new type of pooling layer that helps the network better localize corners. Experiments show that CornerNet achieves a 42.2% AP on MS COCO, outperforming all existing one-stage detectors.

AB Smart services are an important element of the smart cities and the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems where the intelligence behind the services is obtained and improved through the sensory data. Providing a large amount of training data is not always feasible; therefore, we need to consider alternative ways that incorporate unlabeled data as well. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained great success in several application domains. It is an applicable method for IoT and smart city scenarios where auto-generated data can be partially labeled by users' feedback for training purposes. In this paper, we propose a semisupervised DRL model that fits smart city applications as it consumes both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance and accuracy of the learning agent. The model utilizes variational autoencoders as the inference engine for generalizing optimal policies. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed model is the first investigation that extends DRL to the semisupervised paradigm. As a case study of smart city applications, we focus on smart buildings and apply the proposed model to the problem of indoor localization based on Bluetooth low energy signal strength. Indoor localization is the main component of smart city services since people spend significant time in indoor environments. Our model learns the best action policies that lead to a close estimation of the target locations with an improvement of 23% in terms of distance to the target and at least 67% more received rewards compared to the supervised DRL model.

AB For the time being, there are many groundbreaking object detection frameworks used in natural scene images. These algorithms have good detection performance on the data sets of open natural scenes. However, applying these frameworks to remote sensing images directly is not very effective. The existing deep-learning-based object detection algorithms still face some challenges when dealing with remote sensing images because these images usually contain a number of targets with large variations of object sizes as well as interclass similarity. Aiming at the challenges of object detection in optical remote sensing images, we propose an end-to-end cross-scale feature fusion (CSFF) framework, which can effectively improve the object detection accuracy. Specifically, we first use a feature pyramid network (FPN) to obtain multilevel feature maps and then insert a squeeze and excitation (SE) block into the top layer to model the relationship between different feature channels. Next, we use the CSFF module to obtain powerful and discriminative multilevel feature representations. Finally, we implement our work in the framework of Faster region-based CNN (R-CNN). In the experiment, we evaluate our method on a publicly available large-scale data set, named DIOR, and obtain an improvement of 3.0% measured in terms of mAP compared with Faster R-CNN with FPN.

AB The authentication scheme is an important cryptographic mechanism, through which two communication parties could authenticate each other in the open network environment. To satisfy the requirement of practical applications, many authentication schemes using passwords and smart cards have been proposed. However, passwords might be divulged or forgotten, and smart cards might be shared, lost, or stolen. In contrast, biometric methods, such as fingerprints or iris scans, have no such drawbacks. Therefore, biometrics-based authentication schemes gain wide attention. In this paper, we propose a biometrics-based authentication scheme for multiserver environment using elliptic curve cryptography. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first truly three-factor authenticated scheme for multiserver environment. We also demonstrate the completeness of the proposed scheme using the Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic.

AB The positioning accuracy of the existing vehicular Global Positioning System (GPS) is far from sufficient to support autonomous driving and ITS applications. To remedy that, leading methods such as ranging and cooperation have improved the positioning accuracy to varying degrees, but they are still full of challenges in practical applications. Especially for cooperative positioning, in addition to the performance of methods, cooperators may provide false data due to attacks or selfishness, which can seriously affect the positioning accuracy. By fully exploiting the characteristics of blockchain and edge computing, this paper proposes a vehicular blockchain-based secure and efficient GPS positioning error evolution sharing framework, which improves vehicle positioning accuracy from ensuring security and credibility of cooperators and data. First, by analyzing the GPS error, a bridge can be established between the sensor-rich vehicles and the common vehicles to achieve cooperation by sharing the positioning error evolution at a specific time and location. Particularly, the positioning error evolution is obtained by a deep neural network (DNN)-based prediction algorithm running on the edge server. We further propose to use blockchain technology for storage and sharing the evolution of positioning errors, mainly to guarantee the security of cooperative vehicles and mobile edge computing nodes (MECNs). In addition, the corresponding smart contracts are designed to automate and efficiently perform storage and sharing tasks as well as solve inconsistencies in time scales. Extensive simulations based on actual data indicate the accuracy and security of our proposal in terms of positioning error correction and data sharing.

TI Selective Search for Object Recognition
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper addresses the problem of generating possible object locations for use in object recognition. We introduce selective search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and segmentation. Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process. Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations. Instead of a single technique to generate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible. Our selective search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99% recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations. The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition. In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition. The selective search software is made publicly available (Software: http://disi.unitn.it/similar to uijlings/SelectiveSearch.html).

AB We demonstrate the application of deep neural networks as a machine-learning tool for the analysis of a large collection of crystallographic data contained in the crystal structure repositories. Using input data in the form of multiperspective atomic fingerprints, which describe coordination topology around unique crystallographic sites, we show that the neural-network model can be trained to effectively distinguish chemical elements based on the topology of their crystallographic environment. The model also identifies structurally similar atomic sites in the entire data set of similar to 50000 crystal structures, essentially uncovering trends that reflect the periodic table of elements. The trained model was used to analyze templates derived from the known crystal structures in order to predict the likelihood of forming new compounds that could be generated by placing elements into these structural templates in a combinatorial fashion. Statistical analysis of predictive performance of the neural-network model, which was applied to a test set of structures never seen by the model during training, indicates its ability to predict known elemental compositions with a high likelihood of success. In similar to 30% of cases, the known compositions were found among the top 10 most likely candidates proposed by the model. These results suggest that the approach developed in this work can be used to effectively guide the synthetic efforts in the discovery of new materials, especially in the case of systems composed of three or more chemical elements.

AB Spurred by advances in processing power, memory, storage, and an unprecedented wealth of data, computers are being asked to tackle increasingly complex learning tasks, often with astonishing success. Computers have now mastered a popular variant of poker, learned the laws of physics from experimental data, and become experts in video games - tasks that would have been deemed impossible not too long ago. In parallel, the number of companies centered on applying complex data analysis to varying industries has exploded, and it is thus unsurprising that some analytic companies are turning attention to problems in health care. The purpose of this review is to explore what problems in medicine might benefit from such learning approaches and use examples from the literature to introduce basic concepts in machine learning. It is important to note that seemingly large enough medical data sets and adequate learning algorithms have been available for many decades, and yet, although there are thousands of papers applying machine learning algorithms to medical data, very few have contributed meaningfully to clinical care. This lack of impact stands in stark contrast to the enormous relevance of machine learning to many other industries. Thus, part of my effort will be to identify what obstacles there may be to changing the practice of medicine through statistical learning approaches, and discuss how these might be overcome.

AB With the ever increasing social networking and online marketing sites, the reviews and blogs obtained from those, act as an important source for further analysis and improved decision making. These reviews are mostly unstructured by nature and thus, need processing like classification or clustering to provide a meaningful information for future uses. These reviews and blogs may be classified into different polarity groups such as positive, negative, and neutral in order to extract information from the input dataset Supervised machine learning methods help to classify these reviews. In this paper, four different machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes (NB), Maximum Entropy (ME), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been considered for classification of human sentiments. The accuracy of different methods are critically examined in order to access their performance on the basis of parameters such as precision, recall, f-measure, and accuracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Future generation communication systems, such as 5G and 6G wireless systems, exploit the combined satellite-terrestrial communication infrastructures to extend network coverage and data throughput for data-driven applications. These ground-breaking techniques have promoted the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) in maritime industries. In maritime IoT applications, intelligent vessel traffic services can be guaranteed by collecting and analyzing high volume of spatial data flows from automatic identification system (AIS). This AIS system includes a highly integrated automatic equipment, including functionalities of core communication, tracking, and sensing. The increased utilization of shipboard AIS devices allows the collection of massive trajectory data. However, the received raw AIS data often suffers from undesirable outliers (i.e., poorly tracked timestamped points for vessel trajectories) during signal acquisition and analog-to-digital conversion. The degraded AIS data will bring negative effects on vessel traffic services (e.g., maritime traffic monitoring, intelligent maritime navigation, vessel collision avoidance, etc.) in maritime IoT scenarios. To improve the quality of vessel trajectory records from AIS networks, we propose to develop a two-phase data-driven machine learning framework for vessel trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a density-based clustering method is introduced in the first phase to automatically recognize the undesirable outliers. The second phase proposes a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based supervised learning technique to restore the timestamped points degraded by random outliers in vessel trajectories. Comprehensive experiments on simulated and realistic data sets have verified the dominance of our two-phase vessel reconstruction framework compared to other competing methods. It thus has the capacity of promoting intelligent vessel traffic services in 6G-enabled maritime IoT systems.

DT Article
AB Chest CT is emerging as a valuable diagnostic tool for clinical management of COVID-19 associated lung disease. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to aid in rapid evaluation of CT scans for differentiation of COVID-19 findings from other clinical entities. Here we show that a series of deep learning algorithms, trained in a diverse multinational cohort of 1280 patients to localize parietal pleura/lung parenchyma followed by classification of COVID-19 pneumonia, can achieve up to 90.8% accuracy, with 84% sensitivity and 93% specificity, as evaluated in an independent test set (not included in training and validation) of 1337 patients. Normal controls included chest CTs from oncology, emergency, and pneumonia-related indications. The false positive rate in 140 patients with laboratory confirmed other (non COVID-19) pneumonias was 10%. AI-based algorithms can readily identify CT scans with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, as well as distinguish non-COVID related pneumonias with high specificity in diverse patient populations.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to be widely deployed as an integral component in the next generation cellular networks, where spectrum sharing between the aerial and terrestrial communication systems will play an important role. However, there exist significant security and privacy challenges due to the untrusted broadcast features and wireless transmission of the UAV networks. This article endeavors to resolve the security issues through proposing a novel privacy-preserving secure spectrum trading and sharing scheme based on blockchain technology. Specifically, from the operator's perspective, a pricing-based incentive mechanism is first introduced, in which a primary mobile network operator (MNO) leases its owned spectrum to a secondary UAV network in exchange for some revenue from the UAV operators. To address the potential security issues, a spectrum blockchain framework is then proposed to illustrate detailed operations of how the blockchain helps to improve the spectrum trading environment. Under this framework, a Stackelberg game is formulated to jointly maximize the profits of the MNO and the UAV operators considering uniform and nonuniform pricing schemes. Security assessment and numerical results confirm the security and efficiency of our schemes for spectrum sharing in UAV-assisted cellular networks.

AB Mobile-edge computing (MEC) and wireless power transfer are two promising techniques to enhance the computation capability and to prolong the operational time of low-power wireless devices that are ubiquitous in Internet of Things. However, the computation performance and the harvested energy are significantly impacted by the severe propagation loss. In order to address this issue, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled MEC wireless-powered system is studied in this paper. The computation rate maximization problems in a UAV-enabled MEC wireless powered system are investigated under both partial and binary computation offloading modes, subject to the energy-harvesting causal constraint and the UAV's speed constraint. These problems are non-convex and challenging to solve. A two-stage algorithm and a three-stage alternative algorithm are, respectively, proposed for solving the formulated problems. The closed-form expressions for the optimal central processing unit frequencies, user offloading time, and user transmit power are derived. The optimal selection scheme on whether users choose to locally compute or offload computation tasks is proposed for the binary computation offloading mode. Simulation results show that our proposed resource allocation schemes outperform other benchmark schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed schemes converge fast and have low computational complexity.

AB During the past decade, virtual screening (VS) has evolved from traditional similarity searching, which utilizes single reference compounds, into an advanced application domain for data mining and machine-learning approaches, which require large and representative training-set compounds to learn robust decision rules. The explosive growth in the amount of public domain-available chemical and biological data has generated huge effort to design, analyze, and apply novel learning methodologies. Here, I focus on machine-learning techniques within the context of ligand-based VS (LBVS). In addition, I analyze several relevant VS studies from recent publications, providing a detailed view of the current state-of-the-art in this field and highlighting not only the problematic issues, but also the successes and opportunities for further advances.

AB Monthly streamflow forecasting is required for short- and long-term water resources management especially in extreme events such as flood and drought. Therefore, there is need to develop a reliable and precise model for streamflow forecasting. The precision of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can be improved by using hybrid AI models which consist of coupled models. Therefore, the chief aim of this study is to propose efficient hybrid system by integrating Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm with Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. 130 years of monthly historical natural streamflow data will be used to evaluate the performance of the proposed modelling technique. Quantitative performance indicators will be introduced to evaluate the validity of the integrated models; in addition to that, comprehensive analysis will be conducted between the predicted and the observed streamflow. The results show the integrated AI with GWO outperform the standard AI methods and can make better forecasting during training and testing phases for the monthly inflow in all input cases. This finding reveals the superiority of GWO meta-heuristic algorithm in improving the accuracy of the standard AI in forecasting the monthly inflow.

AB Machine learning (ML) is transforming all areas of science. The complex and time-consuming calculations in molecular simulations are particularly suitable for anML revolution and have already been profoundly affected by the application of existing ML methods. Here we review recent ML methods for molecular simulation, with particular focus on (deep) neural networks for the prediction of quantum-mechanical energies and forces, on coarse-grained molecular dynamics, on the extraction of free energy surfaces and kinetics, and on generative network approaches to sample molecular equilibrium structures and compute thermodynamics. To explain these methods and illustrate open methodological problems, we review some important principles of molecular physics and describe how they can be incorporated into ML structures. Finally, we identify and describe a list of open challenges for the interface between ML and molecular simulation.

AB The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increased since the middle of the 20th century as seen in its application in a wide range of engineering and science problems. The last two decades, for example, has seen a dramatic increase in the development and application of various types of Al approaches for stream-flow forecasting. Generally speaking, Al has exhibited significant progress in forecasting and modeling non-linear hydrological applications and in capturing the noise complexity in the dataset. This paper explores the state-of-the-art application of Al in stream-flow forecasting, focusing on defining the data-driven of Al, the advantages of complementary models, as well as the literature and their possible future application in modeling and forecasting stream-flow. The review also identifies the major challenges and opportunities for prospective research, including, a new scheme for modeling the inflow, a novel method for preprocessing time series frequency based on Fast Orthogonal Search (FOS) techniques, and Swarm Intelligence (SI) as an optimization approach.

AB Recently, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), benefited from the breakthrough on the fabrication of programmable meta-material, has been speculated as one of the key enabling technologies for the future six generation (6G) wireless communication systems scaled up beyond massive multiple input multiple output (Massive-MIMO) technology to achieve smart radio environments. Employed as reflecting arrays, RIS is able to assist MIMO transmissions without the need of radio frequency chains resulting in considerable reduction in power consumption. In this paper, we investigate the joint design of transmit beamforming matrix at the base station and the phase shift matrix at the RIS, by leveraging recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We first develop a DRL based algorithm, in which the joint design is obtained through trial-and-error interactions with the environment by observing predefined rewards, in the context of continuous state and action. Unlike the most reported works utilizing the alternating optimization techniques to alternatively obtain the transmit beamforming and phase shifts, the proposed DRL based algorithm obtains the joint design simultaneously as the output of the DRL neural network. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is not only able to learn from the environment and gradually improve its behavior, but also obtains the comparable performance compared with two state-of-the-art benchmarks. It is also observed that, appropriate neural network parameter settings will improve significantly the performance and convergence rate of the proposed algorithm.

AB Floods around the world are having devastating effects on human life and property. In this paper, three Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) analysis techniques (VIKOR, TOPSIS and SAW), along with two machine learning methods (NBT and NB), were tested for their ability to model flood susceptibility in one of China's most flood-prone areas, the Ningdu Catchment. Twelve flood conditioning factors were used as input parameters: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), lithology, land use, distance from river, curvature, altitude, Stream Transport Index (STI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), Stream Power Index (SPI), soil type, slope and rainfall. The predictive capacity of the models was evaluated and validated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). While all models showed a strong flood prediction capability (AUC > 0.95), the NBT model performed best (AUC = 0.98), suggesting that, among the models studied, the NBT model is a promising tool for the assessment of flood-prone areas and can allow for proper planning and management of flood hazards.

AB Learning incorporates a broad range of complex procedures. Machine learning (ML) is a subdivision of artificial intelligence based on the biological learning process. The ML approach deals with the design of algorithms to learn from machine readable data. ML covers main domains such as data mining, difficult to-program applications, and software applications. It is a collection of a variety of algorithms (e.g. neural networks, support vector machines, self-organizing map, decision trees, random forests, case-based reasoning, genetic programming, etc.) that can provide multivariate, nonlinear, nonparametric regression or classification. The modeling capabilities of the ML-based methods have resulted in their extensive applications in science and engineering. Herein, the role of ML as an effective approach for solving problems in geosciences and remote sensing will be highlighted. The unique features of some of the ML techniques will be outlined with a specific attention to genetic programming paradigm. Furthermore, nonparametric regression and classification illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of ML for tackling the geosciences and remote sensing problems.

AB The amount of data extracted from production processes has increased exponentially due to the proliferation of sensing technologies. When processed and analyzed, data can bring out valuable information and knowledge from manufacturing process, production system and equipment. In industries, equipment maintenance is an important key, and affects the operation time of equipment and its efficiency. Thus, equipment faults need to be identified and solved, avoiding shutdown in the production processes. Machine Learning (ML) methods have been emerged as a promising tool in Predictive Maintenance (PdM) applications to prevent failures in equipment that make up the production lines in the factory floor. However, the performance of PdM applications depends on the appropriate choice of the ML method. The aim of this paper is to present a systematic literature review of ML methods applied to PdM, showing which are being explored in this field and the performance of the current state-of-the-art ML techniques. This review focuses on two scientific databases and provides a useful foundation on the ML techniques, their main results, challenges and opportunities, as well as it supports new research works in the PdM field.

ID VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; ENSEMBLE
AB The Big Data revolution promises to transform how we live, work, and think by enabling process optimization, empowering insight discovery and improving decision making. The realization of this grand potential relies on the ability to extract value from such massive data through data analytics; machine learning is at its core because of its ability to learn from data and provide data driven insights, decisions, and predictions. However, traditional machine learning approaches were developed in a different era, and thus are based upon multiple assumptions, such as the data set fitting entirely into memory, what unfortunately no longer holds true in this new context. These broken assumptions, together with the Big Data characteristics, are creating obstacles for the traditional techniques. Consequently, this paper compiles, summarizes, and organizes machine learning challenges with Big Data. In contrast to other research that discusses challenges, this work highlights the cause effect relationship by organizing challenges according to Big Data Vs or dimensions that instigated the issue: volume, velocity, variety, or veracity. Moreover, emerging machine learning approaches and techniques are discussed in terms of how they are capable of handling the various challenges with the ultimate objective of helping practitioners select appropriate solutions for their use cases. Finally, a matrix relating the challenges and approaches is presented. Through this process, this paper provides a perspective on the domain, identifies research gaps and opportunities, and provides a strong foundation and encouragement for further research in the field of machine learning with Big Data.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: We aimed to develop and validate a deep-learning computer-aided detection (CAD) system, suitable for use in real time in clinical practice, to improve endoscopic detection of early neoplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE). METHODS: We developed a hybrid ResNet-UNet model CAD system using 5 independent endoscopy data sets. We performed pretraining using 494,364 labeled endoscopic images collected from all intestinal segments. Then, we used 1704 unique esophageal high-resolution images of rigorously confirmed early-stage neoplasia in BE and nondysplastic BE, derived from 669 patients. System performance was assessed by using data sets 4 and 5. Data set 5 was also scored by 53 general endoscopists with a wide range of experience from 4 countries to benchmark CAD system performance. Coupled with histopathology findings, scoring of images that contained early-stage neoplasia in data sets 2-5 were delineated in detail for neoplasm position and extent by multiple experts whose evaluations served as the ground truth for segmentation. RESULTS: The CAD system classified images as containing neoplasms or nondysplastic BE with 89% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 88% specificity (data set 4, 80 patients and images). In data set 5 (80 patients and images) values for the CAD system vs those of the general endoscopists were 88% vs 73% accuracy, 93% vs 72% sensitivity, and 83% vs 74% specificity. The CAD system achieved higher accuracy than any of the individual 53 nonexpert endoscopists, with comparable delineation performance. CAD delineations of the area of neoplasm overlapped with those from the BE experts in all detected neoplasia in data sets 4 and 5. The CAD system identified the optimal site for biopsy of detected neoplasia in 97% and 92% of cases (data sets 4 and 5, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We developed, validated, and benchmarked a deep-learning computer-aided system for primary detection of neoplasia in patients with BE. The system detected neoplasia with high accuracy and near-perfect delineation performance.

DE Deep compression; deep learning; field-programmable gate array (FPGA);
   quantized neural network (QNN)
AB The quantized neural network (QNN) is an efficient approach for network compression and can be widely used in the implementation of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). This article proposes a novel learning framework for n-bit QNNs, whose weights are constrained to the power of two. To solve the gradient vanishing problem, we propose a reconstructed gradient function for QNNs in the back-propagation algorithm that can directly get the real gradient rather than estimating an approximate gradient of the expected loss. We also propose a novel QNN structure named n-BQ-NN, which uses shift operation to replace the multiply operation and is more suitable for the inference on FPGAs. Furthermore, we also design a shift vector processing element (SVPE) array to replace all 16-bit multiplications with SHIFT operations in convolution operation on FPGAs. We also carry out comparable experiments to evaluate our framework. The experimental results show that the quantized models of ResNet, DenseNet, and AlexNet through our learning framework can achieve almost the same accuracies with the original full-precision models. Moreover, when using our learning framework to train our n-BQ-NN from scratch, it can achieve state-of-the-art results compared with typical low-precision QNNs. Experiments on Xilinx ZCU102 platform show that our n-BQ-NN with our SVPE can execute 2.9 times faster than that with the vector processing element (VPE) in inference. As the SHIFT operation in our SVPE array will not consume digital signal processing (DSP) resources on FPGAs, the experiments have shown that the use of SVPE array also reduces average energy consumption to 68.7% of the VPE array with 16 bit.

AB Unlike 1D or 2D displacement measurement sensors, a motion capture system (MCS) can determine the movement of markers in any direction precisely. In addition, an MCS can overcome the limitations of the sampling frequency in 3D measurements by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and global positioning system (GPS). This paper presents a method to measure three dimensional (3D) structural displacements using a motion capture system (MCS) with a high accuracy and sampling rate. The MCS measures 2D coordinates of a number of markers with multiple cameras; these measurements are then used to calculate the 3D coordinates of markers. Therefore, unlike previous 1D or 2D displacement measurement sensors, the MCS can determine precisely the movement of markers in any direction. In addition, since the MCS cameras can monitor several markers, measurement points are increased by the addition of more markers. The effectiveness of the proposed model was tested by comparing the displacements measured in a free vibration experiment of a 3-story structure with a height of 2.1 m using both the MCS and laser displacement sensors.

AB Accurate, precise and rapid acquisition of topographic data is fundamental to many sub-disciplines of physical geography. Technological developments over the past few decades have made fully distributed data sets of centimetric resolution and accuracy commonplace, yet the emergence of Structure from Motion (SfM) with Multi-View Stereo (MVS) in recent years has revolutionised three-dimensional topographic surveys in physical geography by democratising data collection and processing. SfM-MVS originates from the fields of computer vision and photogrammetry, requires minimal expensive equipment or specialist expertise and, under certain conditions, can produce point clouds of comparable quality to existing survey methods (e.g. Terrestrial Laser Scanning). Consequently, applications of SfM-MVS in physical geography have multiplied rapidly. There are many practical options available to physical geographers when planning a SfM-MVS survey (e.g. platforms, cameras, software), yet, many SfM-MVS end-users are uncertain as to the errors associated with each choice and, perhaps most fundamentally, the processes actually taking place as part of the SfM-MVS workflow. This paper details the typical workflow applied by SfM-MVS software packages, reviews practical details of implementing SfM-MVS, combines existing validation studies to assess practically achievable data quality and reviews the range of applications of SfM-MVS in physical geography. The flexibility of the SfM-MVS approach complicates attempts to validate SfM-MVS robustly as each individual validation study will use a different approach (e.g. platform, camera, georeferencing method, etc.). We highlight the need for greater transparency in SfM-MVS processing and enhanced ability to adjust parameters that determine survey quality. Looking forwards, future prospects of SfM-MVS in physical geography are identified through discussion of more recent developments in the fields of image analysis and computer vision.

AB An intelligent transportation system (ITS) plays an important role in public transport management, security and other issues. Traffic flow detection is an important part of the ITS. Based on the real-time acquisition of urban road traffic flow information, an ITS provides intelligent guidance for relieving traffic jams and reducing environmental pollution. The traffic flow detection in an ITS usually adopts the cloud computing mode. The edge of the network will transmit all the captured video to the cloud computing center. However, the increasing traffic monitoring has brought great challenges to the storage, communication and processing of traditional transportation systems based on cloud computing. To address this issue, a traffic flow detection scheme based on deep learning on the edge node is proposed in this article. First, we propose a vehicle detection algorithm based on the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) model trained with a great volume of traffic data. We pruned the model to ensure its efficiency on the edge equipment. After that, the DeepSORT (Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm is optimized by retraining the feature extractor for multiobject vehicle tracking. Then, we propose a real-time vehicle tracking counter for vehicles that combines the vehicle detection and vehicle tracking algorithms to realize the detection of traffic flow. Finally, the vehicle detection network and multiple-object tracking network are migrated and deployed on the edge device Jetson TX2 platform, and we verify the correctness and efficiency of our framework. The test results indicate that our model can efficiently detect the traffic flow with an average processing speed of 37.9 FPS (frames per second) and an average accuracy of 92.0% on the edge device.

AB The importance of big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning has been at the forefront of research for operations and supply chain management. Literature has reported the influence of big data analytics for improved operational performance, but there has been a paucity of research regarding the role of entrepreneurial orientation (EO) on the adoption of big data analytics. To address this gap, we draw on the dynamic capabilities view of firms and on contingency theory to develop and test a model that describes the role of EO on the adoption of big data analytics powered by artificial intelligence (BDA-AI) and operational performance (OP). We tested our research hypotheses using a survey of 256 responses gathered using a pre-tested questionnaire from manufacturing firms in India with the help of the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). The results from our analysis indicate that EO enables an organisation to exploit and further explore the BDA-AI capabilities to achieve superior OP. Further, our results provide empirical evidence based on data analysis that EO is strongly associated with higher order capabilities (such as BDA-AI) and OP under differential effects of environmental dynamism (ED). These findings extend the dynamic capability view and contingency theory to create better understanding of dynamic capabilities of the organisation while also providing theoretically grounded guidance to the managers to align their EO with their technological capabilities within their firms.

AB Developing algorithms for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) has been an exceedingly difficult task for a long time, due to the notoriously difficult problem known as the "curse of dimensionality." This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach that can handle general high-dimensional parabolic PDEs. To this end, the PDEs are reformulated using backward stochastic differential equations and the gradient of the unknown solution is approximated by neural networks, very much in the spirit of deep reinforcement learning with the gradient acting as the policy function. Numerical results on examples including the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and the Allen-Cahn equation suggest that the proposed algorithm is quite effective in high dimensions, in terms of both accuracy and cost. This opens up possibilities in economics, finance, operational research, and physics, by considering all participating agents, assets, resources, or particles together at the same time, instead of making ad hoc assumptions on their interrelationships.

AB Foreseeing changes in how smart cities manage their resources and provide services to the residents; research, development and production in various relevant technology fields is accelerating. Taking advantage of recent advances and innovations in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), robotics and software; smart cities can optimize resources utilization and enhance operations in health, transportation, energy, and water services, as well as elevating the level of comfort of residents. Effectively and efficiently utilizing ICT and robotics in smart cities will result in reducing costs and resources consumption in addition to engaging more effectively and actively with the citizens. One of these technologies is the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which can provide many applications for smart cities and create a positive impact on the society. For example, UAVs can be used for environmental monitoring, traffic management, pollution monitoring, civil security control, and merchandise delivery. UAV applications among several others can provide cost-effective services to help achieve the objectives of smart cities. However, the integration of UAVs in smart cities is very challenging due to several issues and concerns such as safety, privacy and ethical/legal use. This paper reviews the potential applications integrating UAVs in smart cities, their implications, and the technical and non-technical issues facing such integration. It also discusses regulations and enabling technologies currently available and being developed that can be utilized to support such integration.

AB Recently considerable efforts have been dedicated to unconstrained face recognition, which requires to identify faces "in the wild" for a set of images and/or video frames captured without human intervention. Unlike traditional face recognition that compares one-to-one media (either a single image or a video frame) only, we encounter a problem of matching sets with heterogeneous contents containing both images and videos. In this paper, we propose a novel set-to-set (S2S) distance measure to calculate the similarity between two sets with the aim to improve the recognition accuracy for faces with real-world challenges, such as extreme poses or severe illumination conditions. Our S2S distance adopts the kNN-average pooling for the similarity scores computed on all the media in two sets, making the identification far less susceptible to the poor representations (outliers) than traditional feature-average pooling and score-average pooling. Furthermore, we show that various metrics can he embedded into our S2S distance framework, including both predefined and learned ones. This allows to choose the appropriate metric depending on the recognition task in order to achieve the best results. To evaluate the proposed S2S distance, we conduct extensive experiments on the challenging set-based IJB-A face data set, which demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art results and is clearly superior to the baselines, including several deep learning-based face recognition algorithms.

TI A review of social science on digital agriculture, smart farming and

AB While there is a lot of literature from a natural or technical sciences perspective on different forms of digitalization in agriculture (big data, internet of things, augmented reality, robotics, sensors, 3D printing, system integration, ubiquitous connectivity, artificial intelligence, digital twins, and blockchain among others), social science researchers have recently started investigating different aspects of digital agriculture in relation to farm production systems, value chains and food systems. This has led to a burgeoning but scattered social science body of literature. There is hence lack of overview of how this field of study is developing, and what are established, emerging, and new themes and topics. This is where this article aims to make a contribution, beyond introducing this special issue which presents seventeen articles dealing with social, economic and institutional dynamics of precision farming, digital agriculture, smart farming or agriculture 4.0. An exploratory literature review shows that five thematic clusters of extant social science literature on digitalization in agriculture can be identified: 1) Adoption, uses and adaptation of digital technologies on farm; 2) Effects of digitalization on farmer identity, farmer skills, and farm work; 3) Power, ownership, privacy and ethics in digitalizing agricultural production systems and value chains; 4) Digitalization and agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS); and 5) Economics and management of digitalized agricultural production systems and value chains. The main contributions of the special issue articles are mapped against these thematic clusters, revealing new insights on the link between digital agriculture and farm diversity, new economic, business and institutional arrangements both on-farm, in the value chain and food system, and in the innovation system, and emerging ways to ethically govern digital agriculture. Emerging lines of social science enquiry within these thematic clusters are identified and new lines are suggested to create a future research agenda on digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0. Also, four potential new thematic social science clusters are also identified, which so far seem weakly developed: 1) Digital agriculture socio-cyber-physical-ecological systems conceptualizations; 2) Digital agriculture policy processes; 3) Digitally enabled agricultural transition pathways; and 4) Global geography of digital agriculture development. This future research agenda provides ample scope for future interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary science on precision farming, digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0.

AB Advances in machine learning have changed many fields of study and it has also drawn attention in a variety of remote sensing applications. In particular, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven very useful in fields such as image recognition; however, the use of CNNs in large-scale remote sensing landcover classifications still needs further investigation. We set out to test CNN-based landcover classification against a more conventional XGBoost shallow learning algorithm for mapping a notoriously difficult group of landcover classes, wetland class as defined by the Canadian Wetland Classification System. We developed two wetland inventory style products for a large (397,958 km(2)) area in the Boreal Forest region of Alberta, Canada, using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and ALOS DEM data acquired in Google Earth Engine. We then tested the accuracy of these two products against three validation data sets (two photo-interpreted and one field). The CNN-generated wetland product proved to be more accurate than the shallow learning XGBoost wetland product by 5%. The overall accuracy of the CNN product was 80.2% with a mean F1-score of 0.58. We believe that CNNs are better able to capture natural complexities within wetland classes, and thus may be very useful for complex landcover classifications. Overall, this CNN framework shows great promise for generating large-scale wetland inventory data and may prove useful for other landcover mapping applications.

AB In this paper, we present a survey of deep learning approaches for cyber security intrusion detection, the datasets used, and a comparative study. Specifically, we provide a review of intrusion detection systems based on deep learning approaches. The dataset plays an important role in intrusion detection, therefore we describe 35 well-known cyber datasets and provide a classification of these datasets into seven categories; namely, network traffic-based dataset, electrical network-based dataset, internet traffic-based dataset, virtual private network-based dataset, android apps-based dataset, IoT traffic-based dataset, and internet-connected devices-based dataset. We analyze seven deep learning models including recurrent neural networks, deep neural networks, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks, convolutional neural networks, deep Boltzmann machines, and deep autoencoders. For each model, we study the performance in two categories of classification (binary and multiclass) under two new real traffic datasets, namely, the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset and the Bot-IoT dataset. In addition, we use the most important performance indicators, namely, accuracy, false alarm rate, and detection rate for evaluating the efficiency of several methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Estimation of pressure drops of fresh cemented paste backfill slurry is a novel idea with great potentials. This paper presented a hybrid machine learning (ML) method for improved pressure drops estimation using a combination of artificial neural network and differential evolution. A comprehensive parametric study was conducted on training dataset size (N-size), ML methods, and Monte Carlo random sampling. Moreover, dependent analysis of pressure drops to each influencing variable was performed. The results indicate that 300 Monte Carlo realizations were sufficient for the converged and reliable results. The optimum N-size was determined to be 70%, and the proposed hybrid method outperformed six individual ML methods. The estimation performance has been significantly improved compared to the methods used in the literature (R-2 increased from 0.83 to 0.95 on the testing dataset). Solids content, inlet velocity, SiO2, CaO, and Fe2O3 were determined to be the most significant variables for pressure drops.

AB Epilepsy is a life-threatening and challenging neurological disorder, which is affecting a large number of people all over the world. For its detection, encephalography (EEG) is a commonly used clinical approach, but manual inspection of EEG brain signals is a time-consuming and laborious process, which puts a heavy burden on neurologists and affects their performance. Several automatic systems have been proposed using traditional approaches to assist neurologists, which perform well in detecting binary epilepsy scenarios e.g. normal vs. ictal, but their performance degrades in classifying ternary case e.g. ictal vs. normal vs. inter-ictal. To overcome this problem, we propose a system that is an ensemble of pyramidal one-dimensional convolutional neural network (P-1D-CNN) models. Though a CNN model learns the internal structure of data and outperforms hand-engineered techniques, the main issue is the large number of learnable parameters, whose learning requires a huge volume of data. To overcome this issue, P-1D CNN works on the concept of refinement approach and it involves 61% fewer parameters compared to standard CNN models and as such it has better generalization. Further to overcome the limitations of the small amount of data, we propose two augmentation schemes. We tested the system on the University of Bonn dataset, a benchmark dataset; in almost all the cases concerning epilepsy detection, it gives an accuracy of 99.1 0.9% and outperforms the state-of-the-art systems. In addition, while enjoying the strength of a CNN model, P-1D-CNN model requires 61% less memory space and its detection time is very short (< 0.000481 s), as such it is suitable for real-time clinical setting. It will ease the burden of neurologists and will assist the patients in alerting them before the seizure occurs. The proposed P-1D CNN model is not only suitable for epilepsy detection, but it can be adopted in developing robust expert systems for other similar disorders. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We have devised and implemented a novel computational strategy for de novo design of molecules with desired properties termed ReLeaSE (Reinforcement Learning for Structural Evolution). On the basis of deep and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, ReLeaSE integrates two deep neural networks generative and predictive that are trained separately but are used jointly to generate novel targeted chemical libraries. ReLeaSE uses simple representation of molecules by their simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings only. Generative models are trained with a stack-augmented memory network to produce chemically feasible SMILES strings, and predictive models are derived to forecast the desired properties of the de novo-generated compounds. In the first phase of the method, generative and predictive models are trained separately with a supervised learning algorithm. In the second phase, both models are trained jointly with the RL approach to bias the generation of new chemical structures toward those with the desired physical and/or biological properties. In the proof-of-concept study, we have used the ReLeaSE method to design chemical libraries with a bias toward structural complexity or toward compounds with maximal, minimal, or specific range of physical properties, such as melting point or hydrophobicity, or toward compounds with inhibitory activity against Janus protein kinase 2. The approach proposed herein can find a general use for generating targeted chemical libraries of novel compounds optimized for either a single desired property or multiple properties.

TI Diagnostic outcomes of esophageal cancer by artificial intelligence

SO GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSIFICATION; ENDOSCOPY
AB Background and Aims: The prognosis of esophageal cancer is relatively poor. Patients are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when it is often too late for effective treatment. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning has made remarkable progress in medicine. However, there are no reports on its application for diagnosing esophageal cancer. Here, we demonstrate the diagnostic ability of AI to detect esophageal cancer including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.
   Methods: We retrospectively collected 8428 training images of esophageal cancer from 384 patients at the Cancer Institute Hospital, Japan. Using these, we developed deep learning through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We also prepared 1118 test images for 47 patients with 49 esophageal cancers and 50 patients without esophageal cancer to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy.
   Results: The CNN took 27 seconds to analyze 1118 test images and correctly detected esophageal cancer cases with a sensitivity of 98%. CNN could detect all 7 small cancer lesions less than 10mmin size. Although the positive predictive value for each image was 40%, misdiagnosing shadows and normal structures led to a negative predictive value of 95%. The CNN could distinguish superficial esophageal cancer from advanced cancer with an accuracy of 98%.
   Conclusions: The constructed CNN system for detecting esophageal cancer can analyze stored endoscopic images in a short time with high sensitivity. However, more training would lead to higher diagnostic accuracy. This system can facilitate early detection in practice, leading to a better prognosis in the near future.

AB Deep learning has attracted a lot of attention and has been applied successfully in many areas such as bioinformatics, imaging processing, game playing and computer security etc. On the other hand, deep learning usually requires a lot of training data which may not be provided by a sole owner. As the volume of data gets huge, it is common for users to store their data in a third-party cloud. Due to the confidentiality of the data, data are usually stored in encrypted form. To apply deep learning to these datasets owned by multiple data owners on cloud, we need to tackle two challenges: (i) the data are encrypted with different keys, all operations including intermediate results must be secure; and (ii) the computational cost and the communication cost of the data owner(s) should be kept minimal. In our work, we propose two schemes to solve the above problems. We first present a basic scheme based on multi-key fully homomorphic encryption (MK-FHE), then we propose an advanced scheme based on a hybrid structure by combining the double decryption mechanism and fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). We also prove that these two multi-key privacy-preserving deep learning schemes over encrypted data are secure. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Hyperspectral imagery (HSI) has emerged as a highly successful sensing modality for a variety of applications ranging from urban mapping to environmental monitoring and precision agriculture. Despite the efforts made by the scientific community, developing reliable algorithms of HSI classification remains a challenging problem, especially for high-resolution HSI data where there is often larger intraclass variability combined with a scarcity of the ground-truth data and class imbalance. In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a promising strategy for problems of HSI classification where they have shown remarkable potential for learning joint spectral-spatial features efficiently via backpropagation. In this letter, we propose a deep learning strategy for HSI classification that combines different convolutional neural networks, especially designed to efficiently learn joint spatial-spectral features over multiple scales. Our method achieves an overall classification accuracy of 66.73% on the 2018 IEEE GRSS hyperspectral data set-a high-resolution data set that includes 20 urban land-cover and land-use classes.

AB Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible but preventable blindness in working age populations. Color fundus photography (CFP) is the most cost-effective imaging modality to screen for retinal disorders. However, its application to glaucoma has been limited to the computation of a few related biomarkers such as the vertical cup-to-disc ratio. Deep learning approaches, although widely applied for medical image analysis, have not been extensively used for glaucoma assessment due to the limited size of the available data sets. Furthermore, the lack of a standardize benchmark strategy makes difficult to compare existing methods in a uniform way. In order to overcome these issues we set up the Retinal Fundus Glaucoma Challenge, REFUGE (https://refuge.grand-challenge.org), held in conjunction with MIC-CAI 2018. The challenge consisted of two primary tasks, namely optic disc/cup segmentation and glaucoma classification. As part of REFUGE, we have publicly released a data set of 1200 fundus images with ground truth segmentations and clinical glaucoma labels, currently the largest existing one. We have also built an evaluation framework to ease and ensure fairness in the comparison of different models, encouraging the development of novel techniques in the field. 12 teams qualified and participated in the online challenge. This paper summarizes their methods and analyzes their corresponding results. In particular, we observed that two of the top-ranked teams outperformed two human experts in the glaucoma classification task. Furthermore, the segmentation results were in general consistent with the ground truth annotations, with complementary outcomes that can be further exploited by ensembling the results.

AB The main objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the performance of landslide models using machine learning ensemble technique for landslide susceptibility assessment. This technique is a combination of ensemble methods (AdaBoost, Bagging, Dagging, MultiBoost, Rotation Forest, and Random SubSpace) and the base classifier of Multiple Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP Neural Nets). Ensemble techniques have been widely applied in other fields; however, their application is still rare in the assessment of landslide problems. Meanwhile, MLP Neural Nets, which is known as an artificial neural network, has been applied widely and efficiently in landslide problems. In the present study, landslide models of part Himalayan area (India) have been constructed and validated. For the evaluation and comparison of these models, receiver operating characteristic curve and Chi Square test methods have been applied. Overall, all landslide models performed well in landslide susuceptibility assessment but the performance of the MultiBoost model is the highest (AUC = 0.886), followed by Dagging model (AUC = 0.885), the Rotation Forest model (AUC = 0.882), the Bagging and Random SubSpace models (AUC = 0.881), and the AdaBoost model (AUC = 0.876), respectively. Moreover, machine learning ensemble models have improved significantly the performance of the base classifier of MLP Neural Nets (AUC = 0.874). Analysis of results indicates that landslide models using machine learning ensemble frameworks are promising methods which can be used as alternatives of individual base classifiers for landslide susceptibility assessment of other prone areas.

ID TEXT; FRAMEWORK
AB Video captioning refers to automatic generate natural language sentences, which summarize the video contents. Inspired by the visual attention mechanism of human beings, temporal attention mechanism has been widely used in video description to selectively focus on important frames. However, most existing methods based on temporal attention mechanism suffer from the problems of recognition error and detail missing, because temporal attention mechanism cannot further catch significant regions in frames. In order to address above problems, we propose the use of a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism (STAT) within an encoder-decoder neural network for video captioning. The proposed STAT successfully takes into account both the spatial and temporal structures in a video, so it makes the decoder to automatically select the significant regions in the most relevant temporal segments for word prediction. We evaluate our STAT on two well-known benchmarks: MSVD and MSR-VTT-10K. Experimental results show that our proposed STAT achieves the state-of-the-art performance with several popular evaluation metrics: BLEU-4, METEOR, and CIDEr.

AB The current study aimed at evaluating the capabilities of seven advanced machine learning techniques (MLTs), including, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayes (NB), for landslide susceptibility modeling and comparison of their performances. Coupling machine learning algorithms with spatial data types for landslide susceptibility mapping is a vitally important issue. This study was carried out using GIS and R open source software at Abha Basin, Asir Region, Saudi Arabia. First, a total of 243 landslide locations were identified at Abha Basin to prepare the landslide inventory map using different data sources. All the landslide areas were randomly separated into two groups with a ratio of 70% for training and 30% for validating purposes. Twelve landslide-variables were generated for landslide susceptibility modeling, which include altitude, lithology, distance to faults, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), landuse/landcover (LULC), distance to roads, slope angle, distance to streams, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope length (LS), and slope-aspect. The area under curve (AUC-ROC) approach has been applied to evaluate, validate, and compare the MLTs performance. The results indicated that AUC values for seven MLTs range from 89.0% for QDA to 95.1% for RF. Our findings showed that the RF (AUC = 95.1%) and LDA (AUC = 941.7%) have produced the best performances in comparison to other MLTs. The outcome of this study and the landslide susceptibility maps would be useful for environmental protection.

AB Hyperspectral images (HSIs) data that is typically presented in 3-D format offers an opportunity for 3-D networks to extract spectral and spatial features simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end 3-D dense convolutional network with spectral-wise attention mechanism (MSDN-SA) for HSI classification. The proposed MSDN-SA exploits 3-D dilated convolutions to simultaneously capture the spectral and spatial features at different scales, and densely connects all 3-D feature maps with each other. In addition, a spectral-wise attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the distinguishability of spectral features, which improves the classification performance of the trained models. Experimental results on three HSI datasets demonstrate that our MSDN-SA achieves competitive performance for HSI classification.

AB Motivation: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have outperformed conventional methods in modeling the sequence specificity of DNA-protein binding. Yet inappropriate CNN architectures can yield poorer performance than simpler models. Thus an in-depth understanding of how to match CNN architecture to a given task is needed to fully harness the power of CNNs for computational biology applications.
   Results: We present a systematic exploration of CNN architectures for predicting DNA sequence binding using a large compendium of transcription factor datasets. We identify the best-performing architectures by varying CNN width, depth and pooling designs. We find that adding convolutional kernels to a network is important for motif-based tasks. We show the benefits of CNNs in learning rich higher-order sequence features, such as secondary motifs and local sequence context, by comparing network performance on multiple modeling tasks ranging in difficulty. We also demonstrate how careful construction of sequence benchmark datasets, using approaches that control potentially confounding effects like positional or motif strength bias, is critical in making fair comparisons between competing methods. We explore how to establish the sufficiency of training data for these learning tasks, and we have created a flexible cloud-based framework that permits the rapid exploration of alternative neural network architectures for problems in computational biology.

AB Background: Residential green and blue spaces may be therapeutic for the mental health. However, solid evidence on the linkage between exposure to green and blue spaces and mental health among the elderly in non-Western countries is scarce and limited to exposure metrics based on remote sensing images (i.e., land cover and vegetation indices). Such overhead-view measures may fail to capture how people perceive the environment on the site.
   Objective: This study aimed to compare streetscape metrics derived from street view images with satellite-derived ones for the assessment of green and blue space; and to examine associations between exposure to green and blue spaces as well as geriatric depression in Beijing, China.
   Methods: Questionnaire data on 1190 participants aged 60 or above were analyzed cross-sectionally. Depressive symptoms were assessed through the shortened Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). Streetscape green and blue spaces were extracted from Tencent Street View data by a fully convolutional neural network. Indicators derived from street view images were compared with a satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a normalized difference water index (NDWI), and those derived from GlobeLand30 land cover data on a neighborhood level. Multilevel regressions with neighborhood-level random effects were fitted to assess correlations between GDS-15 scores and these green and blue spaces exposure metrics.
   Results: The average cumulative GDS-15 score was 3.4 (i.e., no depressive symptoms). Metrics of green and blue space derived from street view images were not correlated with satellite-based ones. While NDVI was highly correlated with GlobeLand30 green space, NDWI was moderately correlated with GlobeLand30 blue space. Multilevel regressions showed that both street view green and blue spaces were inversely associated with GDS-15 scores and achieved the highest model goodness-of-fit. No significant associations were found with NDVI, NDWI, and GlobeLand30 green and blue space. Our results passed robustness tests.
   Conclusion: Our findings provide support that street view green and blue spaces are protective against depression for the elderly in China, yet longitudinal confirmation to infer causality is necessary. Street view and satellite-derived green and blue space measures represent different aspects of natural environments. Both street view data and deep learning are valuable tools for automated environmental exposure assessments for health-related studies.

ID NONORTHOGONAL MULTIPLE-ACCESS; DESIGN
AB Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) will provide massive connectivity for future Internet of Things. However, the intrinsic non-orthogonality in NOMA makes it non-trivial to approach the performance limit with only conventional communication-theoretic tools. In this paper, we resort to deep multi-task learning for end-to-end optimization of NOMA, by regarding the overlapped transmissions as multiple distinctive but correlated learning tasks. First of all, we establish a unified multi-task deep neural network (DNN) framework for NOMA, namely DeepNOMA, which consists of a channel module, a multiple access signature mapping module, namely DeepMAS, and a multi-user detection module, namely DeepMUD. DeepMAS and DeepMUD are automatically trained in a data-driven fashion, and a multi-task balancing technique is then proposed to guarantee fairness among tasks as well as to avoid local optima. To further exploit the benefits of communication-domain expertise, we introduce constellation shape prior and inter-task interference cancellation structure into DeepMAS and DeepMUD, respectively. These sophisticated designs help to reduce the implementation complexity without sacrificing DNN & x2019;s universal function approximation property, which makes DeepNOMA a universal transceiver optimization approach. Detailed experiments and link-level simulations show that higher transmission accuracy and lower computational complexity can be simultaneously achieved by DeepNOMA under various channel models, compared with state-of-the-art.

AB Neuromorphic computing systems comprise networks of neurons that use asynchronous events for both computation and communication. This type of representation offers several advantages in terms of bandwidth and power consumption in neuromorphic electronic systems. However, managing the traffic of asynchronous events in large scale systems is a daunting task, both in terms of circuit complexity and memory requirements. Here, we present a novel routing methodology that employs both hierarchical and mesh routing strategies and combines heterogeneous memory structures for minimizing both memory requirements and latency, while maximizing programming flexibility to support a wide range of event-based neural network architectures, through parameter configuration. We validated the proposed scheme in a prototype multicore neuromorphic processor chip that employs hybrid analog/digital circuits for emulating synapse and neuron dynamics together with asynchronous digital circuits for managing the address-event traffic. We present a theoretical analysis of the proposed connectivity scheme, describe the methods and circuits used to implement such scheme, and characterize the prototype chip. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the neuromorphic processor with a convolutional neural network for the real-time classification of visual symbols being flashed to a dynamic vision sensor (DVS) at high speed.

AB The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a recently introduced swarm intelligence algorithm for optimization, which has already been successfully applied for the training of artificial neural network (ANN) models. This paper thoroughly explores the performance of the ABC algorithm for optimizing the connection weights of feed-forward (FF) neural network models, aiming to accurately determine one of the most critical parameters in reinforced concrete structures, namely the fundamental period of vibration. Specifically, this study focuses on the determination of the vibration period of reinforced concrete infilled framed structures, which is essential to earthquake design, using feed-forward ANNs. To this end, the number of storeys, the number of spans, the span length, the infill wall panel stiffness, and the percentage of openings within the infill panel are selected as input parameters, while the value of vibration period is the output parameter. The accuracy of the FF-ABC model is verified through comparison with available formulas in the literature. The results indicate that the artificial neural network, the weights of which had been optimized via the ABC algorithm, exhibits greater ability, flexibility and accuracy in comparison with statistical models.

AB Currently, reliable and accurate ship detection in optical remote sensing images is still challenging. Even the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods cannot obtain very satisfactory results. To more accurately locate the ships in diverse orientations, some recent methods conduct the detection via the rotated bounding box. However, it further increases the difficulty of detection because an additional variable of ship orientation must be accurately predicted in the algorithm. In this article, a novel CNN-based ship-detection method is proposed by overcoming some common deficiencies of current CNN-based methods in ship detection. Specifically, to generate rotated region proposals, current methods have to predefine multioriented anchors and predict all unknown variables together in one regression process, limiting the quality of overall prediction. By contrast, we are able to predict the orientation and other variables independently, and yet more effectively, with a novel dual-branch regression network, based on the observation that the ship targets are nearly rotation-invariant in remote sensing images. Next, a shape-adaptive pooling method is proposed to overcome the limitation of a typical regular region of interest (ROI) pooling in extracting the features of the ships with various aspect ratios. Furthermore, we propose to incorporate multilevel features via the spatially variant adaptive pooling. This novel approach, called multilevel adaptive pooling, leads to a compact feature representation more qualified for the simultaneous ship classification and localization. Finally, a detailed ablation study performed on the proposed approaches is provided, along with some useful insights. Experimental results demonstrate the great superiority of the proposed method in ship detection.

AB Ship target detection using large-scale synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has important application in military and civilian fields. However, ship targets are difficult to distinguish from the surrounding background and many false alarms can occur due to the influence of land area. False alarms always occur with ship target detection because most of the area in large-scale SAR images are treated as background and clutter, and the ship targets are considered unevenly distributing small targets. To address these issues, a ship detection method in large-scale SAR images via CenterNet is proposed in this article. As an anchor-free method, CenterNet defines the target as a point, and the center point of the target is located through key point estimation, which can effectively avoid the missing detection of small targets. At the same time, the spatial shuffle-group enhance (SSE) attention module is introduced into CenterNet. Through SSE, the stronger semantic features are extracted while suppressing some noise to reduce false positives caused by inshore and inland interferences. The experiments on the public SAR-ship-data set show that the proposed method can detect all targets without missed detection with dense-docking targets. For the ship targets in large-scale SAR images from Sentinel 1, the proposed method can also detect targets near the shore and in the sea with high accuracy, which outperforms the methods like faster R-convolutional neural network (CNN), single-shot multibox detector (SSD), you only look once (YOLO), feature pyramid network (FPN), and their variations.

AB In frequency division duplex mode, the downlink channel state information (CSI) should be sent to the base station through feedback links so that the potential gains of a massive multiple-input multiple-output can be exhibited. However, such a transmission is hindered by excessive feedback overhead. In this letter, we use deep learning technology to develop CsiNet, a novel CSI sensing and recovery mechanism that learns to effectively use channel structure from training samples. CsiNet learns a transformation from CSI to a near-optimal number of representations (or codewords) and an inverse transformation from codewords to CSI. We perform experiments to demonstrate that CsiNet can recover CSI with significantly improved reconstruction quality compared with existing compressive sensing (CS)-based methods. Even at excessively low compression regions where CS-based methods cannot work, CsiNet retains effective beamforming gain.

AB Deep learning (DL), a subset of machine learning approaches, has emerged as a versatile tool to assimilate large amounts of heterogeneous data and provide reliable predictions of complex and uncertain phenomena. These tools are increasingly being used by the plant science community to make sense of the large datasets now regularly collected via high-throughput phenotyping and genotyping. We review recent work where DL principles have been utilized for digital image-based plant stress phenotyping. We provide a comparative assessment of DL tools against other existing techniques, with respect to decision accuracy, data size requirement, and applicability in various scenarios. Finally, we outline several avenues of research leveraging current and future DL tools in plant science.

AB Data-driven saliency has recently gained a lot of attention thanks to the use of convolutional neural networks for predicting gaze fixations. In this paper, we go beyond standard approaches to saliency prediction, in which gaze maps are computed with a feed-forward network, and present a novel model which can predict accurate saliency maps by incorporating neural attentive mechanisms. The core of our solution is a convolutional long short-term memory that focuses on the most salient regions of the input image to iteratively refine the predicted saliency map. In addition, to tackle the center bias typical of human eye fixations, our model can learn a set of prior maps generated with Gaussian functions. We show, through an extensive evaluation, that the proposed architecture outperforms the current state-of-the-art on public saliency prediction datasets. We further study the contribution of each key component to demonstrate their robustness on different scenarios.

AB Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are small haemorrhages nearby blood vessels. They have been recognized as important diagnostic biomarkers for many cerebrovascular diseases and cognitive dysfunctions. In current clinical routine, CMBs are manually labelled by radiologists but this procedure is laborious, time-consuming, and error prone. In this paper, we propose a novel automatic method to detect CMBs from magnetic resonance (MR) images by exploiting the 3D convolutional neural network (CNN). Compared with previous methods that employed either low-level hand-crafted descriptors or 2D CNNs, our method can take full advantage of spatial contextual information in MR volumes to extract more representative high-level features for CMBs, and hence achieve a much better detection accuracy. To further improve the detection performance while reducing the computational cost, we propose a cascaded framework under 3D CNNs for the task of CMB detection. We first exploit a 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) strategy to retrieve the candidates with high probabilities of being CMBs, and then apply a well-trained 3D CNN discrimination model to distinguish CMBs from hard mimics. Compared with traditional sliding window strategy, the proposed 3D FCN strategy can remove massive redundant computations and dramatically speed up the detection process. We constructed a large dataset with 320 volumetric MR scans and performed extensive experiments to validate the proposed method, which achieved a high sensitivity of 93.16% with an average number of 2.74 false positives per subject, outperforming previous methods using low-level descriptors or 2D CNNs by a significant margin. The proposed method, in principle, can be adapted to other biomarker detection tasks from volumetric medical data.

AB Air over-pressure (AOp) is one of the products of blasting operations for rock fragmentation in open-pit mines. It can cause structural vibration, smash glass doors, adversely affect the surrounding environment, and even be fatal to humans. To assess its dangerous effects, seven artificial intelligence (AI) methods for predicting specific blast-induced AOp have been applied and compared in this study. The seven methods include random forest, support vector regression, Gaussian process, Bayesian additive regression trees, boosted regression trees, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural network (ANN). An empirical technique was also used to compare with AI models. The degree of complexity and the performance of the models were compared with each other to find the optimal model for predicting blast-induced AOp. The Deo Nai open-pit coal mine (Vietnam) was selected as a case study where 113 blasting events have been recorded. Indicators used for evaluating model performances include the root-mean-square error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R-2), and mean absolute error (MAE). The results indicate that AI techniques provide better performance than the empirical method. Although the relevance of the empirical approach was acceptable (R-2 = 0.930) in this study, its error (RMSE = 7.514) is highly significant to guarantee the safety of the surrounding environment. In contrast, the AI models offer much higher accuracies. Of the seven AI models, ANN was the most dominant model based on RMSE, R-2, and MAE. This study demonstrated that AI techniques are excellent for predicting blast-induced AOp in open-pit mines. These techniques are useful for blasters and managers in controlling undesirable effects of blasting operations on the surrounding environment.

AB Training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch is difficult because it requires a large amount of labeled training data and a great deal of expertise to ensure proper convergence. A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.

AB Background and Aims: Diagnosing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) depends on individual physician expertise and may be subject to interobserver variability. Therefore, we developed a computerized image-analysis system to detect and differentiate esophageal SCC.
   Methods: A total of 9591 nonmagnified endoscopy (non-ME) and 7844 ME images of pathologically confirmed superficial esophageal SCCs and 1692 non-ME and 3435 ME images from noncancerous lesions or normal esophagus were used as training image data. Validation was performed using 255 non-ME white-light images, 268 non-ME narrow-band images/blue-laser images, and 204 ME narrow-band images/blue-laser images from 135 patients. The same validation test data were diagnosed by 15 board-certified specialists (experienced endoscopists).
   Results: Regarding diagnosis by non-ME with narrow-band imaging/blue-laser imaging, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 100%, 63%, and 77%, respectively, for the artificial intelligence (AI) system and 92%, 69%, and 78%, respectively, for the experienced endoscopists. Regarding diagnosis by non-ME with white-light imaging, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 90%, 76%, and 81%, respectively, for the AI system and 87%, 67%, and 75%, respectively, for the experienced endoscopists. Regarding diagnosis by ME, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 98%, 56%, and 77%, respectively, for the AI system and 83%, 70%, and 76%, respectively, for the experienced endoscopists. There was no significant difference in the diagnostic performance between the AI system and the experienced endoscopists.
   Conclusions: Our AI system showed high sensitivity for detecting SCC by non-ME and high accuracy for differentiating SCC from noncancerous lesions by ME.

AB We use deep convolutional neural networks to identify the plant species captured in a photograph and evaluate different factors affecting the performance of these networks. Three powerful and popular deep learning architectures, namely GoogLeNet, AlexNet, and VGGNet, are used for this purpose. Transfer learning is used to fine-tune the pre-trained models, using the plant task datasets of LifeCLEF 2015. To decrease the chance of overfitting, data augmentation techniques are applied based on image transforms such as rotation, translation, reflection, and scaling. Furthermore, the networks' parameters are adjusted and different classifiers are fused to improve overall performance. Our best combined system has achieved an overall accuracy of 80% on the validation set and an overall inverse rank score of 0.752 on the official test set. A comparison of our results against the results of the LifeCLEF 2015 plant identification campaign shows that we have improved the overall validation accuracy of the top system by 15% points and its overall inverse rank score on the test set by 0.1 while outperforming the top three competition participants in all categories. The system recently obtained a very close second place in the P1antCLEF 2016.

ID HYBRID CLASSIFIER; DETECTION SYSTEM; DESIGN
AB The development of an anomaly-based intrusion detection system (IDS) is a primary research direction in the field of intrusion detection. An IDS learns normal and anomalous behavior by analyzing network traffic and can detect unknown and new attacks. However, the performance of an IDS is highly dependent on feature design, and designing a feature set that can accurately characterize network traffic is still an ongoing research issue. Anomaly-based IDSs also have the problem of a high false alarm rate (FAR), which seriously restricts their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel IDS called the hierarchical spatial-temporal features-based intrusion detection system (HAST-IDS), which first learns the low-level spatial features of network traffic using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and then learns high-level temporal features using long short-term memory networks. The entire process of feature learning is completed by the deep neural networks automatically; no feature engineering techniques are required. The automatically learned traffic features effectively reduce the FAR. The standard DARPA1998 and ISCX2012 data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The experimental results show that the HAST-IDS outperforms other published approaches in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and FAR, which successfully demonstrates its effectiveness in both feature learning and FAR reduction.

LA English
DT Article
DE Pose estimation; object detection; articulated shapes; deformable part
   models
AB We describe a method for articulated human detection and human pose estimation in static images based on a new representation of deformable part models. Rather than modeling articulation using a family of warped (rotated and foreshortened) templates, we use a mixture of small, nonoriented parts. We describe a general, flexible mixture model that jointly captures spatial relations between part locations and co-occurrence relations between part mixtures, augmenting standard pictorial structure models that encode just spatial relations. Our models have several notable properties: 1) They efficiently model articulation by sharing computation across similar warps, 2) they efficiently model an exponentially large set of global mixtures through composition of local mixtures, and 3) they capture the dependency of global geometry on local appearance (parts look different at different locations). When relations are tree structured, our models can be efficiently optimized with dynamic programming. We learn all parameters, including local appearances, spatial relations, and co-occurrence relations (which encode local rigidity) with a structured SVM solver. Because our model is efficient enough to be used as a detector that searches over scales and image locations, we introduce novel criteria for evaluating pose estimation and human detection, both separately and jointly. We show that currently used evaluation criteria may conflate these two issues. Most previous approaches model limbs with rigid and articulated templates that are trained independently of each other, while we present an extensive diagnostic evaluation that suggests that flexible structure and joint training are crucial for strong performance. We present experimental results on standard benchmarks that suggest our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, improving past work on the challenging Parse and Buffy datasets while being orders of magnitude faster.

AB Due to the real working conditions and data acquisition equipment, the collected working data of bearings are actually limited. Meanwhile, as the rolling bearing works in the normal state at most times, it is easy to raise the imbalance problem of fault types which restricts the diagnosis accuracy and stability. To solve these problems, we present an imbalanced fault diagnosis method based on the generative adversarial network (GAN) and provide a comparative study in detail. The key idea is utilizing GAN, a kind of deep learning technique, to generate synthetic samples for minority fault class and then improve the generalization ability of the fault diagnosis model. First, this method applies fast Fourier transform to preprocess the original vibration signal and then obtains the frequency spectrum of fault samples. Second, it uses the spectrum data as the input of GAN to generate the synthetic minority samples following the data distribution of the real samples. Finally, it puts the synthetic samples into the training set and builds a stacked denoising auto encoder model for fault diagnosis. To testify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a series of comparative experiments is carried out on the CWRU bearing dataset. The results show that the proposed method can provide a better solution for imbalanced fault diagnosis on the basis of generating similar fault samples. As a comparative study, the proposed method is compared to several diagnostic methods with traditional time-frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms three widely used sample synthesis techniques, such as random oversampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique, and the principal curve-based oversampling method in terms of diagnosis accuracy and numerical stability.

Our main focus is on the state-of-the-art approaches for cultivation and spatial ordering of the network of dissociated hippocampal neuron cells, fabrication of a large-scale cross-bar array of memristive devices tailored using device engineering, resistive state programming, or non-linear dynamics, as well as hardware implementation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) based on the arrays of memristive devices and integrated CMOS electronics. The concept represents an example of a brain-on-chip system belonging to a more general class of memristive neurohybrid systems for a new-generation robotics, artificial intelligence, and personalized medicine, discussed in the framework of the proposed roadmap for the next decade period.

AB Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumors in adults and their early detection is of great importance. In this paper, a method based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed in order to noninvasively classify different grades of Glioma using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the proposed method, the architecture (structure) of the CNN is evolved using GA, unlike existing methods of selecting a deep neural network architecture which are usually based on trial and error or by adopting predefined common structures. Furthermore, to decrease the variance of prediction error, bagging as an ensemble algorithm is utilized on the best model evolved by the GA. To briefly mention the results, in one case study, 90.9 percent accuracy for classifying three Glioma grades was obtained. In another case study, Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary tumor types were classified with 94.2 percent accuracy. The results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method in classifying brain tumor via MRI images. Due to the flexible nature of the method, it can be readily used in practice for assisting the doctor to diagnose brain tumors in an early stage.

AB The vibration signals collected from rolling bearing are usually complex and non-stationary with heavy background noise. Therefore, it is a great challenge to efficiently learn the representative fault features of the collected vibration signals. In this paper, a novel method called improved convolutional deep belief network (CDBN) with compressed sensing (CS) is developed for feature learning and fault diagnosis of rolling bearing. Firstly, CS is adopted for reducing the vibration data amount to improve analysis efficiency. Secondly, a new CDBN model is constructed with Gaussian visible units to enhance the feature learning ability for the compressed data. Finally, exponential moving average (EMA) technique is employed to improve the generalization performance of the constructed deep model. The developed method is applied to analyze the experimental rolling bearing vibration signals. The results confirm that the developed method is more effective than the traditional methods.

AB This article proposes a reinforcement-learning (RL) approach for optimizing charging scheduling and pricing strategies that maximize the system objective of a public electric vehicle (EV) charging station. The proposed algorithm is x201C;onlinex201D; in the sense that the charging and pricing decisions made at each time depend only on the observation of past events, and is x201C;model-freex201D; in the sense that the algorithm does not rely on any assumed stochastic models of uncertain events. To cope with the challenge arising from the time-varying continuous state and action spaces in the RL problem, we first show that it suffices to optimize the total charging rates to fulfill the charging requests before departure times. Then, we propose a feature-based linear function approximator for the statex2013;value function to further enhance the efficiency and generalization ability of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical simulations with real-world data, we show that the proposed RL algorithm achieves on average 138.5x0025; higher charging-station profit than representative benchmark algorithms.

AB Recent research has shown the speed advantage of extreme learning machine (ELM) and the accuracy advantage of sparse representation classification (SRC) in the area of image classification. Those two methods, however, have their respective drawbacks, e.g., in general, ELM is known to be less robust to noise while SRC is known to be time-consuming. Consequently, ELM and SRC complement each other in computational complexity and classification accuracy. In order to unify such mutual complementarity and thus further enhance the classification performance, we propose an efficient hybrid classifier to exploit the advantages of ELM and SRC in this paper. More precisely, the proposed classifier consists of two stages: first, an ELM network is trained by supervised learning. Second, a discriminative criterion about the reliability of the obtained ELM output is adopted to decide whether the query image can be correctly classified or not. If the output is reliable, the classification will be performed by ELM; otherwise the query image will be fed to SRC. Meanwhile, in the stage of SRC, a sub-dictionary that is adaptive to the query image instead of the entire dictionary is extracted via the ELM output. The computational burden of SRC thus can be reduced. Extensive experiments on handwritten digit classification, landmark recognition and face recognition demonstrate that the proposed hybrid classifier outperforms ELM and SRC in classification accuracy with outstanding computational efficiency.

AB A convolutional discriminative feature learning method is presented for induction motor fault diagnosis. The approach firstly utilizes back-propagation (BP)-based neural network to learn local filters capturing discriminative information. Then, a feed-forward convolutional pooling architecture is built to extract final features through these local filters. Due to the discriminative learning of BP-based neural network, the learned local filters can discover potential discriminative patterns. Also, the convolutional pooling architecture is able to derive invariant and robust features. Therefore, the proposed method can learn robust and discriminative representation from the raw sensory data of induction motors in an efficient and automatic way. Finally, the learned representations are fed into support vector machine classifier to identify six different fault conditions. Experiments performed on a machine fault simulator indicate that compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method shows significant performance gains, and it is effective and efficient for induction motor fault diagnosis.

AB In this paper, we make a comparative study of the effectiveness of ensemble technique for sentiment classification. The ensemble framework is applied to sentiment classification tasks, with the aim of efficiently integrating different feature sets and classification algorithms to synthesize a more accurate classification procedure. First, two types of feature sets are designed for sentiment classification, namely the part-of-speech based feature sets and the word-relation based feature sets. Second, three well-known text classification algorithms, namely naive Bayes, maximum entropy and support vector machines, are employed as base-classifiers for each of the feature sets. Third, three types of ensemble methods, namely the fixed combination, weighted combination and meta-classifier combination, are evaluated for three ensemble strategies. A wide range of comparative experiments are conducted on five widely-used datasets in sentiment classification. Finally, some in-depth discussion is presented and conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of ensemble technique for sentiment classification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, a deep neural network, CV19- Net, was trained, validated, and tested on chest radiographs in patients with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. For the chest radiographs positive for COVID-19, patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with findings positive for pneumonia between February 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, were included. For the non-COVID-19 chest radiographs, patients with pneumonia who underwent chest radiography between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019, were included. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to characterize diagnostic performance. To benchmark the performance of CV19-Net, a randomly sampled test data set composed of 500 chest radiographs in 500 patients was evaluated by the CV19-Net and three experienced thoracic radiologists.
   Results: A total of 2060 patients (5806 chest radiographs; mean age, 62 years +/- 16 [standard deviation]; 1059 men) with COVID-19 pneumonia and 3148 patients (5300 chest radiographs; mean age, 64 years 6 18; 1578 men) with non-COVID-19 pneumonia were included and split into training and validation and test data sets. For the test set, CV19-Net achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.93). This corresponded to a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 87, 89) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI: 77, 80) by using a high-sensitivity operating threshold, or a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI: 77, 79) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI: 88, 90) by using a high-specificity operating threshold. For the 500 sampled chest radiographs, CV19-Net achieved an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.96) compared with an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.88) achieved by radiologists.
   Conclusion: CV19-Net was able to differentiate coronavirus disease 2019-related pneumonia from other types of pneumonia, with performance exceeding that of experienced thoracic radiologists. (C) RSNA. 2021

AB High-performance stretchable and wearable electronic skins (E-skins) with high sensitivity and a large sensing range are urgently required with the rapid development of the Internet of things and artificial intelligence. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/polyaniline wrapped sponge is prepared via rGO coating and the in situ synthesis of polyaniline nanowires (PANI NWs) on the backbones of sponge for the fabrication of pressure sensors. From the as-prepared flexible sensor, tunable sensitivity (0.042 to 0.152 kPa(-1)), wide working range (0-27 kPa), fast response (approximate to 96 ms), high current output (approximate to 300 A at 1 V), frequency-dependent performance reliable repeatability (approximate to 9000 cycle) and stable signal waveform output can be readily obtained. In addition to tiny physiological activities (voice recognition, swallowing, mouth opening, blowing and breath), robust human motions (finger bending, elbow movement and knee squatting-arising) can also be detected in real-time by the flexible sensors based on rGO/polyaniline wrapped sponge. All the results demonstrate that the flexible pressure sensor based on the functional-sponge is a promising candidate for healthcare monitoring and wearable circuitry in artificial intelligence.

TI Hunting for open clusters in Gaia DR2: 582 new open clusters in the

AB Context. Open clusters are key targets for studies of Galaxy structure and evolution, and stellar physics. Since the Gaia data release 2 (DR2), the discovery of undetected clusters has shown that previous surveys were incomplete.Aims. Our aim is to exploit the Big Data capabilities of machine learning to detect new open clusters in Gaia DR2, and to complete the open cluster sample to enable further studies of the Galactic disc.Methods. We use a machine-learning based methodology to systematically search the Galactic disc for overdensities in the astrometric space and identify the open clusters using photometric information. First, we used an unsupervised clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, to blindly search for these overdensities in Gaia DR2 (l, b, , mu(*)(alpha), mu(delta)), and then we used a deep learning artificial neural network trained on colour-magnitude diagrams to identify isochrone patterns in these overdensities, and to confirm them as open clusters.Results. We find 582 new open clusters distributed along the Galactic disc in the region vertical bar b vertical bar < 20 degrees. We detect substructure in complex regions, and identify the tidal tails of a disrupting cluster UBC 274 of similar to 3 Gyr located at similar to 2 kpc.Conclusions. Adapting the mentioned methodology to a Big Data environment allows us to target the search using the physical properties of open clusters instead of being driven by computational limitations. This blind search for open clusters in the Galactic disc increases the number of known open clusters by 45%.

AB The quality of the interpretation of the sentiment in the online buzz in the social media and the online news can determine the predictability of financial markets and cause huge gains or losses. That is why a number of researchers have turned their full attention to the different aspects of this problem lately. However, there is no well-rounded theoretical and technical framework for approaching the problem to the best of our knowledge. We believe the existing lack of such clarity on the topic is due to its interdisciplinary nature that involves at its core both behavioral-economic topics as well as artificial intelligence. We dive deeper into the interdisciplinary nature and contribute to the formation of a clear frame of discussion. We review the related works that are about market prediction based on online-text-mining and produce a picture of the generic components that they all have. We, furthermore, compare each system with the rest and identify their main differentiating factors. Our comparative analysis of the systems expands onto the theoretical and technical foundations behind each. This work should help the research community to structure this emerging field and identify the exact aspects which require further research and are of special significance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper provides a review of automated fabric defect detection methods developed in recent years. Fabric defect detection, as a popular topic in automation, is a necessary and essential step of quality control in the textile manufacturing industry. In categorizing these methods broadly, a major group is regarded as non-motif-based while a minor group is treated as motif-based. Non-motif-based approaches are conventional, whereas the motif-based approach is novel in utilizing motif as a basic manipulation unit. Compared with previously published review papers on fabric inspection, this paper firstly offers an up-to-date survey of different defect detection methods and describes their characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. Secondly, it employs a wider classification of methods and divides them into seven approaches (statistical, spectral, model-based, learning, structural, hybrid, and motif-based) and performs a comparative study across these methods. Thirdly, it also presents a qualitative analysis accompanied by results, including detection success rate for every method it has reviewed. Lastly, insights, synergy and future research directions are discussed. This paper shall benefit researchers and practitioners alike in image processing and computer vision fields in understanding the characteristics of the different defect detection approaches.

AB In the past two decades, artificial skin-like materials have received increasing research interests for their broad applications in artificial intelligence, wearable devices, and soft robotics. However, profound challenges remain in terms of imitating human skin because of its unique combination of mechanical and sensory properties. In this work, a bioinspired mineral hydrogel is developed to fabricate a novel type of mechanically adaptable ionic skin sensor. Due to its unique viscoelastic properties, the hydrogel-based capacitive sensor is compliant, self-healable, and can sense subtle pressure changes, such as a gentle finger touch, human motion, or even small water droplets. It might not only show great potential in applications such as artificial intelligence, human/machine interactions, personal healthcare, and wearable devices, but also promote the development of next-generation mechanically adaptable intelligent skin-like devices.

TI Short-Term Wind Speed Forecasting via Stacked Extreme Learning Machine
   With Generalized Correntropy

AB Recently, wind speed forecasting as an effective computing technique plays an important role in advancing industry informatics, while dealing with these issues of control and operation for renewable power systems. However, it is facing some increasing difficulties to handle the large-scale dataset generated in these forecasting applications, with the purpose of ensuring stable computing performance. In response to such limitation, this paper proposes a more practical approach through the combination of extreme-learning machine (ELM) method and deep-learning model. ELM is a novel computing paradigm that enables the neural network (NN) based learning to be achieved with fast training speed and good generalization performance. The stacked ELM (SELM) is an advanced ELM algorithm under deep-learning framework, which works efficiently on memory consumption decrease. In this paper, an enhanced SELM is accordingly developed via replacing the Euclidean norm of the mean square error (MSE) criterion in ELM with the generalized correntropy criterion to further improve the forecasting performance. The advantage of the enhanced SELM with generalized correntropy to achieve better forecasting performance mainly relies on the following aspect. Generalized correntropy is a stable and robust nonlinear similarity measure while employing machine learning method to forecast wind speed, where the outliers may exist in some industrially measured values. Specifically, the experimental results of short-term and ultra-short-term forecasting on real wind speed data show that the proposed approach can achieve better computing performance compared with other traditional and more recent methods.

AB Metasurfaces have attracted widespread attention due to an increasing demand of compact and wearable optical devices. For many applications, polarization-insensitive metasurfaces are highly desirable, and appear to limit the choice of their constituent elements to isotropic nanostructures. This greatly restricts the number of geometric parameters available in design. Here, we demonstrate a polarization-insensitive metalens using otherwise anisotropic nanofins which offer additional control over the dispersion and phase of the output light. As a result, we can render a metalens achromatic and polarization-insensitive across nearly the entire visible spectrum from wavelength lambda = 460 nm to 700 nm, while maintaining diffraction-limited performance. The metalens is comprised of just a single layer of TiO2 nanofins and has a numerical aperture of 0.2 with a diameter of 26.4 mu m. The generality of our polarization-insensitive design allows it to be implemented in a plethora of other metasurface devices with applications ranging from imaging to virtual/augmented reality.

TI ON REMOVING ROUTING PROTOCOL FROM FUTURE WIRELESS NETWORKS: A REAL-TIME
   DEEP LEARNING APPROACH FOR INTELLIGENT TRAFFIC CONTROL
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Recently, deep learning has appeared as a breakthrough machine learning technique for various areas in computer science as well as other disciplines. However, the application of deep learning for network traffic control in wireless/heterogeneous networks is a relatively new area. With the evolution of wireless networks, efficient network traffic control such as routing methodology in the wireless backbone network appears as a key challenge. This is because the conventional routing protocols do not learn from their previous experiences regarding network abnormalities such as congestion and so forth. Therefore, an intelligent network traffic control method is essential to avoid this problem. In this article, we address this issue and propose a new, real-time deep learning based intelligent network traffic control method, exploiting deep Convolutional Neural Networks (deep CNNs) with uniquely characterized inputs and outputs to represent the considered Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) backbone. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposal achieves significantly lower average delay and packet loss rate compared to those observed with the existing routing methods. We particularly focus on our proposed method's independence from existing routing protocols, which makes it a potential candidate to remove routing protocol(s) from future wired/wireless networks.

DT Article
DE Video-based face recognition; video surveillance; blur- and pose-robust
   representations; convolutional neural networks
AB Human faces in surveillance videos often suffer from severe image blur, dramatic pose variations, and occlusion. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to overcome challenges in video-based face recognition (VFR). First, to learn blur-robust face representations, we artificially blur training data composed of clear still images to account for a shortfall in real-world video training data. Using training data composed of both still images and artificially blurred data, CNN is encouraged to learn blur-insensitive features automatically. Second, to enhance robustness of CNN features to pose variations and occlusion, we propose a Trunk-Branch Ensemble CNN model (TBE-CNN), which extracts complementary information from holistic face images and patches cropped around facial components. TBE-CNN is an end-to-end model that extracts features efficiently by sharing the low- and middle-level convolutional layers between the trunk and branch networks. Third, to further promote the discriminative power of the representations learnt by TBE-CNN, we propose an improved triplet loss function. Systematic experiments justify the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. Most impressively, TBE-CNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three popular video face databases: PaSC, COX Face, and YouTube Faces. With the proposed techniques, we also obtain the first place in the BTAS 2016 Video Person Recognition Evaluation.

AB Artificial vision systems are powerful tools for the automatic inspection of fruits and vegetables. Typical target applications of such systems include grading, quality estimation from external parameters or internal features, monitoring of fruit processes during storage or evaluation of experimental treatments. The capabilities of an artificial vision system go beyond the limited human capacity to evaluate long-term processes objectively or to appreciate events that take place outside the visible electromagnetic spectrum. Use of the ultraviolet or near-infrared spectra makes it possible to explore defects or features that the human eye is unable to see. Hyperspectral systems provide information about individual components or damage that can be perceived only at particular wavelengths and can be used as a tool to develop new computer vision systems adapted to particular objectives. In-line grading systems allow huge amounts of fruit or vegetables to be inspected individually and provide statistics about the batch. In general, artificial systems not only substitute human inspection but also improve on its capabilities. This work presents the latest developments in the application of this technology to the inspection of the internal and external quality of fruits and vegetables.

AB In this paper, a modified EMD-FNN model (empirical mode decomposition (EMD) based feed-forward neural network (FNN) ensemble learning paradigm) is proposed for wind speed forecasting. The nonlinear and non-stationary original wind speed series is first decomposed into a finite and often small number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residual series using EMD technique for a deep insight into the data structure. Then these sub-series except the high frequency are forecasted respectively by FNN whose input variables are selected by using partial autocorrelation function (PACF). Finally, the prediction results of the modeled IMFs and residual series are summed to formulate an ensemble forecast for the original wind speed series. Further more, the developed model shows the best accuracy comparing with basic FNN and unmodified EMD-based FNN through multi-step forecasting the mean monthly and daily wind speed in Zhangye of China.

AB Recent work has begun to explore the design of biologically inspired soft robots composed of soft, stretchable materials for applications including the handling of delicate materials and safe interaction with humans. However, the solid-state sensors traditionally used in robotics are unable to capture the high-dimensional deformations of soft systems. Embedded soft resistive sensors have the potential to address this challenge. However, both the soft sensors-and the encasing dynamical system-often exhibit nonlinear time-variant behavior, which makes them difficult to model. In addition, the problems of sensor design, placement, and fabrication require a great deal of human input and previous knowledge. Drawing inspiration from the human perceptive system, we created a synthetic analog. Our synthetic system builds models using a redundant and unstructured sensor topology embedded in a soft actuator, a vision-based motion capture system for ground truth, and a general machine learning approach. This allows us to model an unknown soft actuated system. We demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to model the kinematics of a soft continuum actuator in real time while being robust to sensor nonlinearities and drift. In addition, we show how the same system can estimate the applied forces while interacting with external objects. The role of action in perception is also presented. This approach enables the development of force and deformation models for soft robotic systems, which can be useful for a variety of applications, including human-robot interaction, soft orthotics, and wearable robotics.

AB When we observe a facial expression of emotion, we often mimic it. This automatic mimicry reflects underlying sensorimotor simulation that supports accurate emotion recognition. Why this is so is becoming more obvious: emotions are patterns of expressive, behavioral, physiological, and subjective feeling responses. Activation of one component can therefore automatically activate other components. When people simulate a perceived facial expression, they partially activate the corresponding emotional state in themselves, which provides a basis for inferring the underlying emotion of the expresser. We integrate recent evidence in favor of a role for sensorimotor simulation in emotion recognition. We then connect this account to a domain-general understanding of how sensory information from multiple modalities is integrated to generate perceptual predictions in the brain.

DT Article
ID BAND ACHROMATIC METALENS; DIELECTRIC METASURFACES; HIGH-RESOLUTION;
   PHASE; ULTRACOMPACT
AB Polarization optics plays a pivotal role in diffractive, refractive, and emerging flat optics, and has been widely employed in contemporary optical industries and daily life. Advanced polarization manipulation leads to robust control of the polarization direction of light. Nevertheless, polarization control has been studied largely independent of the phase or intensity of light. Here, we propose and experimentally validate a Malus-metasurface-assisted paradigm to enable simultaneous and independent control of the intensity and phase properties of light simply by polarization modulation. The orientation degeneracy of the classical Malus's law implies a new degree of freedom and enables us to establish a one-to-many mapping strategy for designing anisotropic plasmonic nanostructures to engineer the Pancharatnam-Berry phase profile, while keeping the continuous intensity modulation unchanged. The proposed Malus metadevice can thus generate a near-field greyscale pattern, and project an independent far-field holographic image using an ultrathin and single-sized metasurface. This concept opens up distinct dimensions for conventional polarization optics, which allows one to merge the functionality of phase manipulation into an amplitude-manipulation-assisted optical component to form a multifunctional nano-optical device without increasing the complexity of the nanostructures. It can empower advanced applications in information multiplexing and encryption, anti-counterfeiting, dual-channel display for virtual/augmented reality, and many other related fields.
   Metasurfaces: nanobrick polarizers Metasurfaces made from an array of carefully orientated silver nano-brick polarizers on a silica glass substrate can manipulate the phase and amplitude of light. Fabricated and characterized by a team of researchers in China, Singapore and the UK, the so-called Malus metasurfaces are optimally designed to operate with red light and generate near-field greyscale patterns and far-field holographic images. Potential uses include image multiplexing and encryption, augmented-reality displays and other applications. The metasurfaces consist of nanoscale (160 nm long, 80 nm wide and 70 nm high) cuboids of silver which have a long axis and short axis. Simulations indicate that the nanobricks reflect 92.6% of incident 633 nm-light when its polarization is aligned along the long axis and transmit 95.3% when aligned to its short axis, thus acting as a nanoscale polarizer.

AB The overwhelming majority of scientific knowledge is published as text, which is difficult to analyse by either traditional statistical analysis or modern machine learning methods. By contrast, the main source of machine-interpretable data for the materials research community has come from structured property databases(1,2), which encompass only a small fraction of the knowledge present in the research literature. Beyond property values, publications contain valuable knowledge regarding the connections and relationships between data items as interpreted by the authors. To improve the identification and use of this knowledge, several studies have focused on the retrieval of information from scientific literature using supervised natural language processing(3-10), which requires large hand-labelled datasets for training. Here we show that materials science knowledge present in the published literature can be efficiently encoded as information-dense word embeddings(11-13) (vector representations of words) without human labelling or supervision. Without any explicit insertion of chemical knowledge, these embeddings capture complex materials science concepts such as the underlying structure of the periodic table and structure-property relationships in materials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an unsupervised method can recommend materials for functional applications several years before their discovery. This suggests that latent knowledge regarding future discoveries is to a large extent embedded in past publications. Our findings highlight the possibility of extracting knowledge and relationships from the massive body of scientific literature in a collective manner, and point towards a generalized approach to the mining of scientific literature.

AB The goal of this study was to assess the water status variability of a commercial rain-fed Tempranillo vineyard (Vitis vinifera L.) by thermal and multispectral imagery using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The relationships between aerial temperatures or indices derived from the imagery and leaf stomatal conductance (g (s)) and stem water potential (I-stem) were determined. Aerial temperature was significantly correlated with g (s) (R (2) = 0.68, p < 0.01) and I-stem (R (2) = 0.50, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the thermal indices derived from aerial imagery were also strongly correlated with I-stem and g (s). Moreover, different spectral indices were related to vineyard water status, although NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and TCARI/OSAVI (ratio between transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance and optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index) showed the highest coefficient of determination with I-stem (R (2) = 0.68, p < 0.05) and g (s) (R (2) = 0.84, p < 0.05), respectively. While the relationship with thermal imagery and water status parameters could be considered as a short-term response, NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI indices were probably reflecting the result of cumulative water deficits, hence a long-term response. In conclusion, thermal and multispectral imagery using an UAV allowed assessing and mapping spatial variability of water status within the vineyard.

A feedback controller based on sliding mode control is firstly imported in the synchronization of DRNNs. The activation functional in our paper can be more relaxed than the other papers which should satisfy the Lipschitz conditions. For the sake of reducing the computational complexity and conservatism, we consider two quantized methods with uniform and logarithmic quantizer. We gain some specific conditions to ensure the synchronization of discrete-time system. Several examples are presented to support our theorem in the ending. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper, a novel method is developed for the stability problem of a class of neural networks with time-varying delay. New delay-dependent stability criteria in terms of linear matrix inequalities for recurrent neural networks with time-varying delay are derived by the newly proposed augmented simple Lyapunov-Krasovski functional. Different from previous results by using the first-order convex combination property, our derivation applies the idea of second-order convex combination and the property of quadratic convex function which is given in the form of a lemma without resorting to Jensen's inequality. A numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the presented results.

AB BACKGROUND & AIMS: Scoring systems are suboptimal for determining risk in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB); these might be improved by a machine learning model. Weused machine learning to develop amodel to calculate the risk of hospital-based intervention or death in patients with UGIB and compared its performance with other scoring systems. METHODS: We analyzed data collected from consecutive unselected patients with UGIB from medical centers in 4 countries (the United States, Scotland, England, and Denmark; n = 1958) from March 2014 through March 2015. We used the data to derive and internally validate a gradient-boosting machine learning model to identify patients who met a composite endpoint of hospital-based intervention (transfusion or hemostatic intervention) or death within 30 days. We compared the performance of the machine learning prediction model with validated pre-endoscopic clinical risk scoring systems (the Glasgow-Blatchford score [GBS], admission Rockall score, and AIMS65). We externally validated the machine learningmodel using data from 2 Asia-Pacific sites (Singapore and New Zealand; n = 399). Performance was measured by area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. RESULTS: The machine learning model identified patients who met the composite endpoint with an AUC of 0.91 in the internal validation set; the clinical scoring systems identified patients who met the composite endpoint with AUC values of 0.88 for the GBS (P =.001), 0.73 for Rockall score (P <.001), and 0.78 for AIMS65 score (P <.001). In the external validation cohort, the machine learning model identified patients who met the composite endpoint with an AUC of 0.90, the GBS with an AUC of 0.87 (P =.004), the Rockall score with an AUC of 0.66 (P <.001), and the AIMS65 with an AUC of 0.64 (P <.001). At cutoff scores at which the machine learning model and GBS identified patients who met the composite endpoint with 100% sensitivity, the specificity values were 26% with the machine learning model versus 12% with GBS (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a machine learning model that identifies patients with UGIB who met a composite endpoint of hospital-based intervention or death within 30 days with a greater AUC and higher levels of specificity, at 100% sensitivity, than validated clinical risk scoring systems. This model could increase identification of low-risk patients who can be safely discharged from the emergency department for outpatient management.

AB The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment, is essential for timely treatment and possible delay of AD. Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both largescale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM- SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is applied to the ADNI dataset to conduct both binary classification andmulticlass classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that MM-SDPN is superior over the state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithms for AD diagnosis.

AB This study aims to analyze the sensitivity and robustness of two Artificial Intelligence (Al) techniques, namely Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with five different kernels (Matern32, Matern52, Exponential, Squared Exponential, and Rational Quadratic) and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using a Monte Carlo simulation for prediction of High-Performance Concrete (HPC) compressive strength. To this purpose, 1030 samples were collected, including eight input parameters (contents of cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and concrete age) and an output parameter (the compressive strength) to generate the training and testing datasets. The proposed Al models were validated using several standard criteria, namely coefficient of determination (R-2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). To analyze the sensitivity and robustness of the models, Monte Carlo simulations were performed with 500 runs. The results showed that the GPR using the Matern32 kernel function outperforms others. In addition, the sensitivity analysis showed that the content of cement and the testing age of the HPC were the most sensitive and important factors for the prediction of HPC compressive strength. In short, this study might help in selecting suitable Al models and appropriate input parameters for accurate and quick estimation of the HPC compressive strength.

AB In this paper, we employ a novel method for solving the problem of the global exponential stability of quaternion-valued recurrent neural networks (QVNNs) with time-varying delays. Theoretically, a QVNN can be separated into four real-valued systems, forming an equivalent real-valued system. From the view of matrix measure, based on Halanay inequality instead of Lyapunov function, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the global exponential stability for QVNNs. Moreover, the activation functions are not assumed to be derivative any more, which makes the analytical procedure compact. Finally, a numerical example is provided to validate the advantage of the proposed method and to show the effectiveness of the main results.

TI Sentiment Strength Detection for the Social Web

LA English
DT Article
ID POLARITY; OPINIONS
AB Sentiment analysis is concerned with the automatic extraction of sentiment-related information from text. Although most sentiment analysis addresses commercial tasks, such as extracting opinions from product reviews, there is increasing interest in the affective dimension of the social web, and Twitter in particular. Most sentiment analysis algorithms are not ideally suited to this task because they exploit indirect indicators of sentiment that can reflect genre or topic instead. Hence, such algorithms used to process social web texts can identify spurious sentiment patterns caused by topics rather than affective phenomena. This article assesses an improved version of the algorithm SentiStrength for sentiment strength detection across the social web that primarily uses direct indications of sentiment. The results from six diverse social web data sets (MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Digg, Runners World, BBC Forums) indicate that SentiStrength 2 is successful in the sense of performing better than a baseline approach for all data sets in both supervised and unsupervised cases. SentiStrength is not always better than machine-learning approaches that exploit indirect indicators of sentiment, however, and is particularly weaker for positive sentiment in news-related discussions. Overall, the results suggest that, even unsupervised, SentiStrength is robust enough to be applied to a wide variety of different social web contexts.

AB Unsupervised feature learning from the raw vibration data is a great challenge for rolling bearing intelligent fault diagnosis. In this paper, a novel method called deep wavelet auto-encoder (DWAE) with extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed for intelligent fault diagnosis of rolling bearing. Firstly, wavelet function is employed as the nonlinear activation function to design wavelet auto-encoder (WAE), which can effectively capture the signal characteristics. Secondly, a DWAE is constructed with multiple WAEs to enhance the unsupervised feature learning ability. Finally, ELM is adopted as the classifier to accurately identify different bearing faults. The proposed method is applied to analyze the experimental bearing vibration signals, and the results confirm that the proposed method is superior to the traditional methods and standard deep learning methods.

AB This article provides an overview of current applications of machine learning (ML) in seismology. ML techniques are becoming increasingly widespread in seismology, with applications ranging from identifying unseen signals and patterns to extracting features that might improve our physical understanding. The survey of the applications in seismology presented here serves as a catalyst for further use of ML. Five research areas in seismology are surveyed in which ML classification, regression, clustering algorithms show promise: earthquake detection and phase picking, earthquake early warning (EEW), ground-motion prediction, seismic tomography, and earthquake geodesy. We conclude by discussing the need for a hybrid approach combining data-driven ML with traditional physical modeling.

AB Large scale nonlinear support vector machines (SVMs) can be approximated by linear ones using a suitable feature map. The linear SVMs are in general much faster to learn and evaluate (test) than the original nonlinear SVMs. This work introduces explicit feature maps for the additive class of kernels, such as the intersection, Hellinger's, and chi(2) kernels, commonly used in computer vision, and enables their use in large scale problems. In particular, we: 1) provide explicit feature maps for all additive homogeneous kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; 2) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on a spectral analysis; and 3) quantify the error of the approximation, showing that the error is independent of the data dimension and decays exponentially fast with the approximation order for selected kernels such as chi(2). We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernels yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVMs. We also compare with two other approximation methods: Nystrom's approximation of Perronnin et al. [1], which is data dependent, and the explicit map of Maji and Berg [2] for the intersection kernel, which, as in the case of our approximations, is data independent. The approximations are evaluated on a number of standard data sets, including Caltech-101 [3], Daimler-Chrysler pedestrians [4], and INRIA pedestrians [5].

TI Stop explaining black box machine learning models for high stakes
   decisions and use interpretable models instead
SO NATURE MACHINE INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID RECIDIVISM; CAPACITY
AB Black box machine learning models are currently being used for high-stakes decision making throughout society, causing problems in healthcare, criminal justice and other domains. Some people hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.
   There has been a recent rise of interest in developing methods for 'explainable AI', where models are created to explain how a first 'black box' machine learning model arrives at a specific decision. It can be argued that instead efforts should be directed at building inherently interpretable models in the first place, in particular where they are applied in applications that directly affect human lives, such as in healthcare and criminal justice.

AB We present a method for solving partial differential equations using artificial neural networks and an adaptive collocation strategy. In this procedure, a coarse grid of training points is used at the initial training stages, while more points are added at later stages based on the value of the residual at a larger set of evaluation points. This method increases the robustness of the neural network approximation and can result in significant computational savings, particularly when the solution is non-smooth. Numerical results are presented for benchmark problems for scalar-valued PDEs, namely Poisson and Helmholtz equations, as well as for an inverse acoustics problem.

AB Rapid and accurate biomass and yield estimation facilitates efficient plant phenotyping and site-specific crop management. A low altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to acquire RGB and hyperspectral imaging data for a potato crop canopy at two growth stages to estimate the above-ground biomass and predict crop yield. Field experiments included six cultivars and multiple treatments of nitrogen, potassium, and mixed compound fertilisers. Crop height was estimated using the difference between digital surface model and digital elevation models derived from RGB imagery. Combining with two narrow-band vegetation indices selected by the RReliefF feature selection algorithm. Random Forest regression models demonstrated high prediction accuracy for both fresh and dry above-ground biomass, with a coefficient of determination (r(2)) > 0.90. Crop yield was predicted using four narrowband vegetation indices and crop height (r(2) = 0.63) with imagery data obtained 90 days after planting. A Partial Least Squares regression model based on the full wavelength spectra demonstrated improved yield prediction (r(2 )= 0.81). This study demonstrated the merits of UAV-based RGB and hyperspectral imaging for estimating the above-ground biomass and yield of potato crops, which can be used to assist in site-specific crop management.

AB The H-infinity control design problem is considered for nonlinear systems with unknown internal system model. It is known that the nonlinear H-infinity control problem can be transformed into solving the so-called Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation, which is a nonlinear partial differential equation that is generally impossible to be solved analytically. Even worse, model-based approaches cannot be used for approximately solving HJI equation, when the accurate system model is unavailable or costly to obtain in practice. To overcome these difficulties, an off-policy reinforcement leaning (RL) method is introduced to learn the solution of HJI equation from real system data instead of mathematical system model, and its convergence is proved. In the off-policy RL method, the system data can be generated with arbitrary policies rather than the evaluating policy, which is extremely important and promising for practical systems. For implementation purpose, a neural network (NN)-based actor-critic structure is employed and a least-square NN weight update algorithm is derived based on the method of weighted residuals. Finally, the developed NN-based off-policy RL method is tested on a linear F16 aircraft plant, and further applied to a rotational/translational actuator system.

AB Pervasive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) is visible across the globe. The 2016 Dyn cyberattack exposed the critical fault-lines among smart networks. Security of IoT has become a critical concern. The danger exposed by infested Internet-connected Things not only affects the security of IoT but also threatens the complete Internet eco-system which can possibly exploit the vulnerable Things (smart devices) deployed as botnets. Mirai malware compromised the video surveillance devices and paralyzed Internet via distributed denial of service attacks. In the recent past, security attack vectors have evolved both ways, in terms of complexity and diversity. Hence, to identify and prevent or detect novel attacks, it is important to analyze techniques in IoT context. This survey classifies the IoT security threats and challenges for IoT networks by evaluating existing defense techniques. Our main focus is on network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs); hence, this paper reviews existing NIDS implementation tools and datasets as well as free and open-source network sniffing software. Then, it surveys, analyzes, and compares state-of-the-art NIDS proposals in the IoT context in terms of architecture, detection methodologies, validation strategies, treated threats, and algorithm deployments. The review deals with both traditional and machine learning (ML) NIDS techniques and discusses future directions. In this survey, our focus is on IoT NIDS deployed via ML since learning algorithms have a good success rate in security and privacy. The survey provides a comprehensive review of NIDSs deploying different aspects of learning techniques for IoT, unlike other top surveys targeting the traditional systems. We believe that, this paper will be useful for academia and industry research, first, to identify IoT threats and challenges, second, to implement their own NIDS and finally to propose new smart techniques in IoT context considering IoT limitations. Moreover, the survey will enable security individuals differentiate IoT NIDS from traditional ones.

ID COUPLED DICTIONARY
AB In many computer vision systems, the same object can be observed at varying viewpoints or even by different sensors, which brings in the challenging demand for recognizing objects from distinct even heterogeneous views. In this work we propose a Multi-view Discriminant Analysis (MvDA) approach, which seeks for a single discriminant common space for multiple views in a non-pairwise manner by jointly learning multiple view-specific linear transforms. Specifically, our MvDA is formulated to jointly solve the multiple linear transforms by optimizing a generalized Rayleigh quotient, i.e., maximizing the between-class variations and minimizing the within-class variations from both intra-view and inter-view in the common space. By reformulating this problem as a ratio trace problem, the multiple linear transforms are achieved analytically and simultaneously through generalized eigenvalue decomposition. Furthermore, inspired by the observation that different views share similar data structures, a constraint is introduced to enforce the view-consistency of the multiple linear transforms. The proposed method is evaluated on three tasks: face recognition across pose, photo versus. sketch face recognition, and visual light image versus near infrared image face recognition on Multi-PIE, CUFSF and HFB databases respectively. Extensive experiments show that our MvDA achieves significant improvements compared with the best known results.

AB Effective health diagnosis provides multifarious benefits such as improved safety, improved reliability and reduced costs for operation and maintenance of complex engineered systems. This paper presents a novel multi-sensor health diagnosis method using deep belief network (DBN). DBN has recently become a popular approach in machine learning for its promised advantages such as fast inference and the ability to encode richer and higher order network structures. The DBN employs a hierarchical structure with multiple stacked restricted Boltzmann machines and works through a layer by layer successive learning process. The proposed multi-sensor health diagnosis methodology using DBN based state classification can be structured in three consecutive stages: first, defining health states and preprocessing sensory data for DBN training and testing; second, developing DBN based classification models for diagnosis of predefined health states; third, validating DBN classification models with testing sensory dataset. Health diagnosis using DBN based health state classification technique is compared with four existing diagnosis techniques. Benchmark classification problems and two engineering health diagnosis applications: aircraft engine health diagnosis and electric power transformer health diagnosis are employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

AB Machine learning (ML) is rapidly revolutionizing many fields and is starting to change landscapes for physics and chemistry. With its ability to solve complex tasks autonomously, ML is being exploited as a radically new way to help find material correlations, understand materials chemistry, and accelerate the discovery of materials. Here, an in-depth review of the application of ML to energy materials, including rechargeable alkali-ion batteries, photovoltaics, catalysts, thermoelectrics, piezoelectrics, and superconductors, is presented. A conceptual framework is first provided for ML in materials science, with a broad overview of different ML techniques as well as best practices. This is followed by a critical discussion of how ML is applied in energy materials. This review is concluded with the perspectives on major challenges and opportunities in this exciting field.

AB Transformer oil-based nanofluids are known to have higher thermal conductivity and heat transfer performance compared to conventional transformer oils. In this study, four different types of transformer oil-based nanofluids are synthesized using the well-known two-step method. The first nanofluid contains pure multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), while other samples consist of 20 Vol% of MWCNTs and 80 Vol% of different oxide nanoparticles (i.e., Al2O3, TiO2, and SiO2). The dynamic viscosity and thermal conductivity of prepared samples are investigated in seven different volume fractions of 0.001, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1%. Besides, the breakdown voltage of the pure transformer oil and nanofluids containing 0.05 and 0.1 Vol% of nanoparticles is investigated. The outcomes show that dielectric properties of hybrid carbon-based nanofluids are far better compared to those properties of the pure MWCNTs nanofluids. Finally, eight different soft computing approaches, including group method of data handling (GMDH), support vector machine (SVM), radial basis function (RBF) neural network, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and MLP and RBF models optimized with bat and grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), are used to model the viscosity and thermal conductivity of synthesized nanofluids. The outcomes show that the GMDH approach significantly outperforms all other models in terms of predicting the thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity of transformer oil-based nanofluids.

AB This two-part Review examines how automation has contributed to different aspects of discovery in the chemical sciences. In this first part, we describe a classification for discoveries of physical matter (molecules, materials, devices), processes, and models and how they are unified as search problems. We then introduce a set of questions and considerations relevant to assessing the extent of autonomy. Finally, we describe many case studies of discoveries accelerated by or resulting from computer assistance and automation from the domains of synthetic chemistry, drug discovery, inorganic chemistry, and materials science. These illustrate how rapid advancements in hardware automation and machine learning continue to transform the nature of experimentation and modeling. Part two reflects on these case studies and identifies a set of open challenges for the field.

AB We offer a systematic analysis of the use of deep learning networks for stock market analysis and prediction. Its ability to extract features from a large set of raw data without relying on prior knowledge of predictors makes deep learning potentially attractive for stock market prediction at high frequencies. Deep learning algorithms vary considerably in the choice of network structure, activation function, and other model parameters, and their performance is known to depend heavily on the method of data representation. Our study attempts to provides a comprehensive and objective assessment of both the advantages and drawbacks of deep learning algorithms for stock market analysis and prediction. Using high frequency intraday stock returns as input data, we examine the effects of three unsupervised feature extraction methods principal component analysis, autoencoder, and the restricted Boltzmann machine on the network's overall ability to predict future market behavior. Empirical results suggest that deep neural networks can extract additional information from the residuals of the autoregressive model and improve prediction performance; the same cannot be said when the autoregressive model is applied to the residuals of the network. Covariance estimation is also noticeably improved when the predictive network is applied to covariance-based market structure analysis. Our study offers practical insights and potentially useful directions for further investigation into how deep learning networks can be effectively used for stock market analysis and prediction.

AB This paper proposes a novel residual attentive learning network architecture for predicting dynamic eye-fixation maps. The proposed model emphasizes two essential issues, <italic>i.e</italic>., effective spatiotemporal feature integration and multi-scale saliency learning. For the first problem, appearance and motion streams are tightly coupled via dense residual cross connections, which integrate appearance information with multi-layer, comprehensive motion features in a residual and dense way. Beyond traditional two-stream models learning appearance and motion features separately, such design allows early, multi-path information exchange between different domains, leading to a unified and powerful spatiotemporal learning architecture. For the second one, we propose a composite attention mechanism that learns multi-scale local attentions and global attention priors end-to-end. It is used for enhancing the fused spatiotemporal features via emphasizing important features in multi-scales. A lightweight convolutional Gated Recurrent Unit (convGRU), which is flexible for small training data situation, is used for long-term temporal characteristics modeling. Extensive experiments over four benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the advantage of the proposed video saliency model over other competitors and the effectiveness of each component of our network. Our code and all the results will be available at <uri>https://github.com/ashleylqx/STRA-Net</uri>.

AB According to various international reports, Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) is one of the currently emerging fields in educational technology. Whilst it has been around for about 30 years, it is still unclear for educators how to make pedagogical advantage of it on a broader scale, and how it can actually impact meaningfully on teaching and learning in higher education. This paper seeks to provide an overview of research on AI applications in higher education through a systematic review. Out of 2656 initially identified publications for the period between 2007 and 2018, 146 articles were included for final synthesis, according to explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. The descriptive results show that most of the disciplines involved in AIEd papers come from Computer Science and STEM, and that quantitative methods were the most frequently used in empirical studies. The synthesis of results presents four areas of AIEd applications in academic support services, and institutional and administrative services: 1. profiling and prediction, 2. assessment and evaluation, 3. adaptive systems and personalisation, and 4. intelligent tutoring systems. The conclusions reflect on the almost lack of critical reflection of challenges and risks of AIEd, the weak connection to theoretical pedagogical perspectives, and the need for further exploration of ethical and educational approaches in the application of AIEd in higher education.

AB The new Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an emerging disease responsible for infecting millions of people since the first notification until nowadays. Developing efficient short-term forecasting models allow forecasting the number of future cases. In this context, it is possible to develop strategic planning in the public health system to avoid deaths. In this paper, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR), and stacking-ensemble learning are evaluated in the task of time series forecasting with one, three, and six-days ahead the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian states with a high daily incidence. In the stacking-ensemble learning approach, the CUBIST regression, RF, RIDGE, and SVR models are adopted as base-learners and Gaussian process (GP) as meta-learner. The models' effectiveness is evaluated based on the improvement index, mean absolute error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage error criteria. In most of the cases, the SVR and stacking-ensemble learning reach a better performance regarding adopted criteria than compared models. In general, the developed models can generate accurate forecasting, achieving errors in a range of 0.87%-3.51%, 1.02%-5.63%, and 0.95%-6.90% in one, three, and six-days-ahead, respectively. The ranking of models, from the best to the worst regarding accuracy, in all scenarios is SVR, stacking-ensemble learning, ARIMA, CUBIST, RIDGE, and RF models. The use of evaluated models is recommended to forecasting and monitor the ongoing growth of COVID-19 cases, once these models can assist the managers in the decision-making support systems.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in marine wildlife research. As technological developments rapidly advance the versatility and functionality of affordable UAVs, their potential as a marine aerial survey tool is quickly gaining attention. Currently, there is significant interest in whether cost-effective UAVs can outperform manned aircraft in aerial surveys of marine fauna at sea, although few empirical studies have compared relative sampling efficiency, accuracy and precision. Civil aviation restrictions, and subsequent available civilian technologies, make it unlikely that UAVs will currently be more effective than manned aircraft for large area marine surveys. UAVs do, however, have the capacity to fill a niche for intensive smaller spatial scale sampling and for undertaking aerial surveys in isolated locations. Improvements in UAV sensor resolutions and alternative sensor types, such as multispectral cameras, may increase area coverage, reduce perception error, and increase water penetration for sightability. Additionally, the further development of auto-detection software will rapidly improve image processing and further reduce human observer error inherent in manned aerial surveys. As UAV technologies and associated methodology is further developed and becomes more affordable, these aircraft will be increasingly adopted as a marine aerial survey tool in place of traditional methods using manned aircraft.

AB The discovery and development of novel materials in the field of energy are essential to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Bringing recent technological innovations in automation, robotics and computer science together with current approaches in chemistry, materials synthesis and characterization will act as a catalyst for revolutionizing traditional research and development in both industry and academia. This Perspective provides a vision for an integrated artificial intelligence approach towards autonomous materials discovery, which, in our opinion, will emerge within the next 5 to 10 years. The approach we discuss requires the integration of the following tools, which have already seen substantial development to date: high-throughput virtual screening, automated synthesis planning, automated laboratories and machine learning algorithms. In addition to reducing the time to deployment of new materials by an order of magnitude, this integrated approach is expected to lower the cost associated with the initial discovery. Thus, the price of the final products (for example, solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles) will also decrease. This in turn will enable industries and governments to meet more ambitious targets in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a faster pace.

AB Building change detection (CD), important for its application in urban monitoring, can be performed in near real time by comparing prechange and postchange very-highspatial-resolution (VHR) synthetic-aperture-radar (SAR) images. However, multitemporal VHR SAR images are complex as they show high spatial correlation, prone to shadows, and show an inhomogeneous signature. Spatial context needs to be taken into account to effectively detect a change in such images. Recently, convolutional-neural-network (CNN)-based transfer learning techniques have shown strong performance for CD in VHR multispectral images. However, its direct use for SAR CD is impeded by the absence of labeled SAR data and, thus, pretrained networks. To overcome this, we exploit the availability of paired unlabeled SAR and optical images to train for the suboptimal task of transcoding SAR images into optical images using a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). The CycleGAN consists of two generator networks: one for transcoding SAR images into the optical image domain and the other for projecting optical images into the SAR image domain. After unsupervised training, the generator transcoding SAR images into optical ones is used as a bitemporal deep feature extractor to extract optical-like features from bitemporal SAR images. Thus, deep change vector analysis (DCVA) and fuzzy rules can be applied to identify changed buildings (new/destroyed). We validate our method on two data sets made up of pairs of bitemporal VHR SAR images on the city of L'Aquila (Italy) and Trento (Italy).

AB The primate visual system achieves remarkable visual object recognition performance even in brief presentations, and under changes to object exemplar, geometric transformations, and background variation (a.k.a. core visual object recognition). This remarkable performance is mediated by the representation formed in inferior temporal (IT) cortex. In parallel, recent advances in machine learning have led to ever higher performing models of object recognition using artificial deep neural networks (DNNs). It remains unclear, however, whether the representational performance of DNNs rivals that of the brain. To accurately produce such a comparison, a major difficulty has been a unifying metric that accounts for experimental limitations, such as the amount of noise, the number of neural recording sites, and the number of trials, and computational limitations, such as the complexity of the decoding classifier and the number of classifier training examples. In this work, we perform a direct comparison that corrects for these experimental limitations and computational considerations. As part of our methodology, we propose an extension of "kernel analysis" that measures the generalization accuracy as a function of representational complexity. Our evaluations show that, unlike previous bio-inspired models, the latest DNNs rival the representational performance of IT cortex on this visual object recognition task. Furthermore, we show that models that perform well on measures of representational performance also perform well on measures of representational similarity to IT, and on measures of predicting individual IT multi-unit responses. Whether these DNNs rely on computational mechanisms similar to the primate visual system is yet to be determined, but, unlike all previous bio-inspired models, that possibility cannot be ruled out merely on representational performance grounds.

AB Great strides have been made in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) research over the past half-century. However, this progress has created both opportunities and challenges. From a geographic perspective, certain challenges remain, including the modelling of geographic-featured environments with GIS data model, the enhancement of GIS's analysis functions for comprehensive geographic analysis and achieving human-oriented geographic information presentation. Several basic theoretical and technical ideas that follow the workflow and processes of geographic information induction, geographic scenario modelling, geographic process analysis and geographic environment representation are proposed to fill the gaps between GIS and geography. We also call for designing methods for big geographic data-oriented analysis, making best use of videos and developing virtual geographic scenario-based GIS for further evolution.

AB Lack of typical fault samples remains a huge challenge for intelligent fault diagnosis of gearbox. In this paper, a novel approach named deep transfer multi-wavelet auto-encoder is presented for gearbox intelligent fault diagnosis with few training samples. Firstly, new-type deep multi-wavelet auto-encoder is designed for learning important features of the collected vibration signals of gearbox. Secondly, high-quality auxiliary samples are selected based on similarity measure to well pre-train a source model sharing similar characteristics with the target domain. Thirdly, parameter knowledge acquired from the source model is transferred to target model using very few target training samples. Transfer diagnosis cases for different fault severities and compound faults of gearbox confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach even if the working conditions have significant changes.

AB Conventional remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) system usually performs single-label retrieval where each image is annotated by a single label representing the most significant semantic content of the image. In this scenario, however, the scene complexity of remote sensing images is ignored, where an image might have multiple classes (i.e., multiple labels), resulting in poor retrieval performance. We therefore propose a novel multilabel RSIR approach based on fully convolutional network (FCN). Specifically, FCN is first trained to predict segmentation map of each image in the considered image archive. We then obtain multilabel vector and extract region convolutional features of each image based on its segmentation map. The extracted region features are finally used to perform region-based multilabel retrieval. The experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in contrast to handcrafted and convolutional neural network features.

AB Fast diagnostic methods can control and prevent the spread of pandemic diseases like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and assist physicians to better manage patients in high workload conditions. Although a laboratory test is the current routine diagnostic tool, it is time-consuming, imposing a high cost and requiring a well-equipped laboratory for analysis. Computed tomography (CT) has thus far become a fast method to diagnose patients with COVID-19. However, the performance of radiologists in diagnosis of COVID-19 was moderate. Accordingly, additional investigations are needed to improve the performance in diagnosing COVID-19. In this study is suggested a rapid and valid method for COVID-19 diagnosis using an artificial intelligence technique based. 1020 CT slices from 108 patients with laboratory proven COVID-19 (the COVID-19 group) and 86 patients with other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases (the non-COVID-19 group) were included. Ten well-known convolutional neural networks were used to distinguish infection of COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 groups: AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and Xception. Among all networks, the best performance was achieved by ResNet-101 and Xception. ResNet-101 could distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases with an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 99.02%; accuracy, 99.51%). Xception achieved an AUC of 0.994 (sensitivity, 98.04%; specificity, 100%; accuracy, 99.02%). However, the performance of the radiologist was moderate with an AUC of 0.873 (sensitivity, 89.21%; specificity, 83.33%; accuracy, 86.27%). ResNet-101 can be considered as a high sensitivity model to characterize and diagnose COVID-19 infections, and can be used as an adjuvant tool in radiology departments.

AB Low-rank representation (LRR) has recently attracted a great deal of attention due to its pleasing efficacy in exploring low-dimensional subspace structures embedded in data. For a given set of observed data corrupted with sparse errors, LRR aims at learning a lowest-rank representation of all data jointly. LRR has broad applications in pattern recognition, computer vision and signal processing. In the real world, data often reside on low-dimensional manifolds embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. However, the LRR method does not take into account the non-linear geometric structures within data, thus the locality and similarity information among data may be missing in the learning process. To improve LRR in this regard, we propose a general Laplacian regularized low-rank representation framework for data representation where a hypergraph Laplacian regularizer can be readily introduced into, i.e., a Non-negative Sparse Hyper-Laplacian regularized LRR model (NSHLRR). By taking advantage of the graph regularizer, our proposed method not only can represent the global low-dimensional structures, but also capture the intrinsic non-linear geometric information in data. The extensive experimental results on image clustering, semi-supervised image classification and dimensionality reduction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Over the past 20 years, neuroscience research on reward-based learning has converged on a canonical model, under which the neurotransmitter dopamine 'stamps in' associations between situations, actions and rewards by modulating the strength of synaptic connections between neurons. However, a growing number of recent findings have placed this standard model under strain. We now draw on recent advances in artificial intelligence to introduce a new theory of reward-based learning. Here, the dopamine system trains another part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, to operate as its own free-standing learning system. This new perspective accommodates the findings that motivated the standard model, but also deals gracefully with a wider range of observations, providing a fresh foundation for future research.

AB Recent advances in research tools for the systematic analysis of textual data are enabling exciting new research throughout the social sciences. For comparative politics, scholars who are often interested in non-English and possibly multilingual textual datasets, these advances may be difficult to access. This article discusses practical issues that arise in the processing, management, translation, and analysis of textual data with a particular focus on how procedures differ across languages. These procedures are combined in two applied examples of automated text analysis using the recently introduced Structural Topic Model. We also show how the model can be used to analyze data that have been translated into a single language via machine translation tools. All the methods we describe here are implemented in open-source software packages available from the authors.

AB The advent of new data-mining techniques and, more recently, swarm-based optimization algorithms have antiquated traditional models in the field of energy performance analysis. This paper investigates the potential of two state-of-the-art hybrid methods, namely grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) and gray wolf optimization (GWO) in improving the neural assessment of heating load (HL) of residential buildings. To achieve this goal, eight HL influential factors including glazing area distribution, relative compactness, overall height, surface area, roof area, wall area, orientation, and glazing area are considered for preparing the required dataset. A population-based sensitivity analysis is then carried out to use the best-fitted structures of each ensemble. The results showed that utilizing both GOA and GWO algorithms results in increasing the accuracy of the neural network. From comparison viewpoint, it was found that the GWO (error = 2.2899 and correlation = 0.9551) surpasses GOA (error = 2.4459 and correlation = 0.9486) in adjusting the computational parameters of the proposed neural system.

AB Blast-induced flyrock is a hazardous and undesirable phenomenon that may occur in surface mines, especially when blasting takes place near residential areas. Therefore, accurate prediction of flyrock distance is of high significance in the determination of the statutory danger area. To this end, there is a practical need to propose an accurate model to predict flyrock. Aiming at this topic, this study presents two machine learning models, including extreme learning machine (ELM) and outlier robust ELM (ORELM), for predicting flyrock. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigates the use of ORELM model in the field of flyrock prediction. To construct and verify the proposed ELM and ORELM models, a database including 82 datasets has been collected from the three granite quarry sites in Malaysia. Additionally, artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple regression models were used for comparison. According to the results, both ELM and ORELM models performed satisfactorily, and their performances were far better compared to the performances of ANN and multiple regression models.

AB This perspective provides an overview of early developments, current status, and remaining challenges of microLED (mu LED) technology, which was first reported in Applied Physics Letters in 2000 [S. X. Jin, J. Li, J. Z. Li, J. Y. Lin and H. X. Jiang, "GaN Microdisk Light Emitting Diodes," Appl. Phys. Lett. 76, 631 (2000)]. Today, microLED is recognized as the ultimate display technology and is one of the fastest-growing technologies in the world as technology giants utilize it on a wide range of products from large flat panel displays and televisions, wearable displays, and virtual reality displays to light sources for the neural interface and optogenetics. It is anticipated that the collective R&D efforts worldwide will bring microLED products not only to the mass consumer electronic markets but also to serve the society on the broadest scale by encompassing sectors in medical/health, energy, transportation, communications, and entertainment.

AB In plant phenotyping, it has become important to be able to measure many features on large image sets in order to aid genetic discovery. The size of the datasets, now often captured robotically, often precludes manual inspection, hence the motivation for finding a fully automated approach. Deep learning is an emerging field that promises unparalleled results on many data analysis problems. Building on artificial neural networks, deep approaches have many more hidden layers in the network, and hence have greater discriminative and predictive power. We demonstrate the use of such approaches as part of a plant phenotyping pipeline. We show the success offered by such techniques when applied to the challenging problem of image-based plant phenotyping and demonstrate state-of-the-art results (> 97% accuracy) for root and shoot feature identification and localization. We use fully automated trait identification using deep learning to identify quantitative trait loci in root architecture datasets. The majority (12 out of 14) of manually identified quantitative trait loci were also discovered using our automated approach based on deep learning detection to locate plant features. We have shown deep learning-based phenotyping to have very good detection and localization accuracy in validation and testing image sets. We have shown that such features can be used to derive meaningful biological traits, which in turn can be used in quantitative trait loci discovery pipelines. This process can be completely automated. We predict a paradigm shift in image-based phenotyping bought about by such deep learning approaches, given sufficient training sets.

AB Landslides are one of the catastrophic natural hazards that occur in mountainous areas, leading to loss of life, damage to properties, and economic disruption. Landslide susceptibility models prepared in a Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated environment can be key for formulating disaster prevention measures and mitigating future risk. The accuracy and precision of susceptibility models is evolving rapidly from opinion-driven models and statistical learning toward increased use of machine learning techniques. Critical reviews on opinion-driven models and statistical learning in landslide susceptibility mapping have been published, but an overview of current machine learning models for landslide susceptibility studies, including background information on their operation, implementation, and performance is currently lacking. Here, we present an overview of the most popular machine learning techniques available for landslide susceptibility studies. We find that only a handful of researchers use machine learning techniques in landslide susceptibility mapping studies. Therefore, we present the architecture of various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in plain language, so as to be understandable to a broad range of geoscientists. Furthermore, a comprehensive study comparing the performance of various ML algorithms is absent from the current literature, making an assessment of comparative performance and predictive capabilities difficult. We therefore undertake an extensive analysis and comparison between different ML techniques using a case study from Algeria. We summarize and discuss the algorithm's accuracies, advantages and limitations using a range of evaluation criteria. We note that tree-based ensemble algorithms achieve excellent results compared to other machine learning algorithms and that the Random Forest algorithm offers robust performance for accurate landslide susceptibility mapping with only a small number of adjustments required before training the model.

DE Biometrics; ECG; Deep learning
ID HUMAN IDENTIFICATION; VERIFICATION
AB Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals have been successfully used to perform biometric recognition in a wide range of applications. However, ECG-based biometric systems are usually less accurate than technologies based on other physiological traits. To increase their performance, it is necessary to study novel approaches. Deep learning methods, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can automatically extract distinctive features, and have demonstrated their effectiveness for other biometric systems. In this paper, we present Deep-ECG, a CNN-based biometric approach for ECG signals. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature that uses a CNN for ECG biometrics. Deep-ECG extracts significant features from one or more leads using a deep CNN and compares biometric templates by computing simple and fast distance functions, obtaining remarkable accuracy for identification, verification and periodic re-authentication. Furthermore, using a simple quantization procedure, Deep-ECG can obtain binary templates that can facilitate the use of ECG-based biometric systems in conjunction with cryptographic applications. We also propose a simple method to enlarge the training dataset of ECG samples, which can increase the performance of deep neural networks. We performed experiments on large sets of samples acquired in uncontrolled conditions, proving the accuracy and robustness of-Deep-ECG in non-ideal scenarios. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of Deep-ECG for the PTB Diagnostic ECG Database, obtaining identification accuracy better or comparable to the best performing methods in the literature, also for signals with different characteristics with respect to the ones used to train the CNN.

   RISK; BIAS; TOOL; FDA
AB OBJECTIVE
   To systematically examine the design, reporting standards, risk of bias, and claims of studies comparing the performance of diagnostic deep learning algorithms for medical imaging with that of expert clinicians.
   DESIGN
   Systematic review.
   DATA SOURCES
   Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization trial registry from 2010 to June 2019.
   ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES
   Randomised trial registrations and non-randomised studies comparing the performance of a deep learning algorithm in medical imaging with a contemporary group of one or more expert clinicians. Medical imaging has seen a growing interest in deep learning research. The main distinguishing feature of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in deep learning is that when CNNs are fed with raw data, they develop their own representations needed for pattern recognition. The algorithm learns for itself the features of an image that are important for classification rather than being told by humans which features to use. The selected studies aimed to use medical imaging for predicting absolute risk of existing disease or classification into diagnostic groups (eg, disease or non-disease). For example, raw chest radiographs tagged with a label such as pneumothorax or no pneumothorax and the CNN learning which pixel patterns suggest pneumothorax.
   REVIEW METHODS
   Adherence to reporting standards was assessed by using CONSORT (consolidated standards of reporting trials) for randomised studies and TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) for non-randomised studies. Risk of bias was assessed by using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised studies and PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool) for non-randomised studies.
   RESULTS
   Only 10 records were found for deep learning randomised clinical trials, two of which have been published (with low risk of bias, except for lack of blinding, and high adherence to reporting standards) and eight are ongoing. Of 81 non-randomised clinical trials identified, only nine were prospective and just six were tested in a real world clinical setting. The median number of experts in the comparator group was only four (interquartile range 2-9). Full access to all datasets and code was severely limited (unavailable in 95% and 93% of studies, respectively). The overall risk of bias was high in 58 of 81 studies and adherence to reporting standards was suboptimal (<50% adherence for 12 of 29 TRIPOD items). 61 of 81 studies stated in their abstract that performance of artificial intelligence was at least comparable to (or better than) that of clinicians. Only 31 of 81 studies (38%) stated that further prospective studies or trials were required.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Few prospective deep learning studies and randomised trials exist in medical imaging. Most nonrandomised trials are not prospective, are at high risk of bias, and deviate from existing reporting standards. Data and code availability are lacking in most studies, and human comparator groups are often small. Future studies should diminish risk of bias, enhance real world clinical relevance, improve reporting and transparency, and appropriately temper conclusions.

AB The focus of wireless research is increasingly shifting toward 6G as 5G deployments get underway. At this juncture, it is essential to establish a vision of future communications to provide guidance for that research. In this paper, we attempt to paint a broad picture of communication needs and technologies in the timeframe of 6G. The future of connectivity is in the creation of digital twin worlds that are a true representation of the physical and biological worlds at every spatial and time instant, unifying our experience across these physical, biological and digital worlds. New themes are likely to emerge that will shape 6G system requirements and technologies, such as: (i) new man-machine interfaces created by a collection of multiple local devices acting in unison; (ii) ubiquitous universal computing distributed among multiple local devices and the cloud; (iii) multi-sensory data fusion to create multi-verse maps and new mixed-reality experiences; and (iv) precision sensing and actuation to control the physical world. With rapid advances in artificial intelligence, it has the potential to become the foundation for the 6G air interface and network, making data, compute and energy the new resources to be exploited for achieving superior performance. In addition, in this paper we discuss the other major technology transformations that are likely to define 6G: (i) cognitive spectrum sharing methods and new spectrum bands; (ii) the integration of localization and sensing capabilities into the system definition, (iii) the achievement of extreme performance requirements on latency and reliability; (iv) new network architecture paradigms involving sub-networks and RAN-Core convergence; and (v) new security and privacy schemes.

ID SPECTRAL-SPATIAL CLASSIFICATION; FEATURE-EXTRACTION
AB Deep-learning-basedmethods have displayed promising performance for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, due to their capacity of extracting deep features from HSI. However, these methods usually require a large number of training samples. It is quite difficult for deep-learning model to provide representative feature expression for HSI data when the number of samples are limited. In this paper, a novel simplified deep-learning model, rolling guidance filter (RGF) and vertex component analysis network (R-VCANet), is proposed, which achieves higher accuracy when the number of training samples is not abundant. In R-VCANet, the inherent properties of HSI data, spatial information and spectral characteristics, are utilized to construct the network. And by this means the obtained model could generate more powerful feature expression with less samples. First, spectral and spatial information are combined via the RGF, which could explore the contextual structure features and remove small details from HSI. More importantly, we have designed a new network called vertex component analysis network for deep features extraction from the smoothed HSI. Experiments on three popular datasets indicate that the proposed R-VCANet based method reveals better performance than some state-of-the-art methods, especially when the training samples available are not abundant.

AB Radiological reporting has generated large quantities of digital content within the electronic health record, which is potentially a valuable source of information for improving clinical care and supporting research. Although radiology reports are stored for communication and documentation of diagnostic imaging, harnessing their potential requires efficient and automated information extraction: they exist mainly as free-text clinical narrative, from which it is a major challenge to obtain structured data. Natural language processing (NLP) provides techniques that aid the conversion of text into a structured representation, and thus enables computers to derive meaning from human (ie, natural language) input. Used on radiology reports, NLP techniques enable automatic identification and extraction of information. By exploring the various purposes for their use, this review examines how radiology benefits from NLP. A systematic literature search identified 67 relevant publications describing NLP methods that support practical applications in radiology. This review takes a close look at the individual studies in terms of tasks (ie, the extracted information), the NLP methodology and tools used, and their application purpose and performance results. Additionally, limitations, future challenges, and requirements for advancing NLP in radiology will be discussed. (C) RSNA, 2016

AB Back propagation (BP) based on stochastic gradient descent is the prevailing method to train multilayer neural networks (MNNs) with hidden layers. However, the existence of the physical separation between memory arrays and arithmetic module makes it inefficient and ineffective to implement BP in conventional digital hardware. Although CMOS may alleviate some problems of the hardware implementation of MNNs, synapses based on CMOS cost too much power and areas in very large scale integrated circuits. As a novel device, memristor shows promises to overcome this shortcoming due to its ability to closely integrate processing and memory. This paper proposes a novel circuit for implementing a synapse based on a memristor and two MOSFET tansistors (p-type and n-type). Compared with a CMOS-only circuit, the proposed one reduced the area consumption by 92%-98%. In addition, we develop a fuzzy method for the adjustment of the learning rates of MNNs, which increases the learning accuracy by 2%-3% compared with a constant learning rate. Meanwhile, the fuzzy adjustment method is robust and insensitive to parameter changes due to the approximate reasoning. Furthermore, the proposed methods can be extended to memristor-based multilayer convolutional neural network for complex tasks. The novel architecture behaves in a human-liking thinking process.

AB Remote sensing image scene classification plays an important role in a wide range of applications and hence has been receiving remarkable attention. During the past years, significant efforts have been made to develop various data sets or present a variety of approaches for scene classification from remote sensing images. However, a systematic review of the literature concerning data sets and methods for scene classification is still lacking. In addition, almost all existing data sets have a number of limitations, including the small scale of scene classes and the image numbers, the lack of image variations and diversity, and the saturation of accuracy. These limitations severely limit the development of new approaches especially deep learning-based methods. This paper first provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress. Then, we propose a large-scale data set, termed "NWPU-RESISC45," which is a publicly available benchmark for REmote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC), created by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). This data set contains 31 500 images, covering 45 scene classes with 700 images in each class. The proposed NWPU-RESISC45 1) is large-scale on the scene classes and the total image number; 2) holds big variations in translation, spatial resolution, viewpoint, object pose, illumination, background, and occlusion; and 3) has high within-class diversity and between-class similarity. The creation of this data set will enable the community to develop and evaluate various data-driven algorithms. Finally, several representative methods are evaluated using the proposed data set, and the results are reported as a useful baseline for future research.

AB In this brief, a novel adaptive-critic-based neural network (NN) controller is investigated for nonlinear pure-feedback systems. The controller design is based on the transformed predictor form, and the actor-critic NN control architecture includes two NNs, whereas the critic NN is used to approximate the strategic utility function, and the action NN is employed to minimize both the strategic utility function and the tracking error. A deterministic learning technique has been employed to guarantee that the partial persistent excitation condition of internal states is satisfied during tracking control to a periodic reference orbit. The uniformly ultimate boundedness of closed-loop signals is shown via Lyapunov stability analysis. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control.

AB For many computer vision and machine learning problems, large training sets are key for good performance. However, the most computationally expensive part of many computer vision and machine learning algorithms consists of finding nearest neighbor matches to high dimensional vectors that represent the training data. We propose new algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor matching and evaluate and compare them with previous algorithms. For matching high dimensional features, we find two algorithms to be the most efficient: the randomized k-d forest and a new algorithm proposed in this paper, the priority search k-means tree. We also propose a new algorithm for matching binary features by searching multiple hierarchical clustering trees and show it outperforms methods typically used in the literature. We show that the optimal nearest neighbor algorithm and its parameters depend on the data set characteristics and describe an automated configuration procedure for finding the best algorithm to search a particular data set. In order to scale to very large data sets that would otherwise not fit in the memory of a single machine, we propose a distributed nearest neighbor matching framework that can be used with any of the algorithms described in the paper. All this research has been released as an open source library called fast library for approximate nearest neighbors (FLANN), which has been incorporated into OpenCV and is now one of the most popular libraries for nearest neighbor matching.

AB In modern industrial processes, soft sensors have played an important role for effective process control, optimization, and monitoring. Feature representation is one of the core factors to construct accurate soft sensors. Recently, deep learning techniques have been developed for high-level abstract feature extraction in pattern recognition areas, which also have great potential for soft sensing applications. Hence, deep stacked autoencoder (SAE) is introduced for soft sensor in this paper. As for output prediction purpose, traditional deep learning algorithms cannot extract high-level output-related features. Thus, a novel variable-wise weighted stacked autoencoder (VW-SAE) is proposed for hierarchical output-related feature representation layer by layer. By correlation analysis with the output variable, important variables are identified from other ones in the input layer of each autoencoder. The variables are assigned with different weights accordingly. Then, variable-wise weighted autoencoders are designed and stacked to form deep networks. An industrial application shows that the proposed VW-SAE can give better prediction performance than the traditional multilayer neural networks and SAE.

AB To mitigate the impact of climate change and global warming, the use of renewable energies is increasing day by day significantly. A considerable amount of electricity is generated from renewable energy sources since the last decade. Among the potential renewable energies, photovoltaic (PV) has experienced enormous growth in electricity generation. A large number of PV systems have been installed in on-grid and off-grid systems in the last few years. The number of PV systems will increase rapidly in the future due to the policies of the government and international organizations, and the advantages of PV technology. However, the variability of PV power generation creates different negative impacts on the electric grid system, such as the stability, reliability, and planning of the operation, aside from the economic benefits. Therefore, accurate forecasting of PV power generation is significantly important to stabilize and secure grid operation and promote large-scale PV power integration. A good number of research has been conducted to forecast PV power generation in different perspectives. This paper made a comprehensive and systematic review of the direct forecasting of PV power generation. The importance of the correlation of the input-output data and the preprocessing of model input data are discussed. This review covers the performance analysis of several PV power forecasting models based on different classifications. The critical analysis of recent works, including statistical and machine-learning models based on historical data, is also presented. Moreover, the strengths and weaknesses of the different forecasting models, including hybrid models, and performance matrices in evaluating the forecasting model, are considered in this research. In addition, the potential benefits of model optimization are also discussed.

AB Models based on deep convolutional networks have dominated recent image interpretation tasks; we investigate whether models which are also recurrent are effective for tasks involving sequences, visual and otherwise. We describe a class of recurrent convolutional architectures which is end-to-end trainable and suitable for large-scale visual understanding tasks, and demonstrate the value of these models for activity recognition, image captioning, and video description. In contrast to previous models which assume a fixed visual representation or perform simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are "doubly deep" in that they learn compositional representations in space and time. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Differentiable recurrent models are appealing in that they can directly map variable-length inputs (e.g., videos) to variable-length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent sequence models are directly connected to modern visual convolutional network models and can be jointly trained to learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show that such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined or optimized.

TI Single-shot absolute 3D shape measurement with deep-learning-based color
   fringe projection profilometry
SO OPTICS LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
ID ALGORITHMS
AB Recovering the high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) surface of an object from a single frame image has been the ultimate goal long pursued in fringe projection profilometry (FPP). The color fringe projection method is one of the technologies with the most potential towards such a goal due to its three-channel multiplexing properties. However, the associated color imbalance, crosstalk problems, and. compromised coding strategy remain major obstacles to overcome. Inspired by recent successes of deep learning for FPP, we propose a single-shot absolute 3D shape measurement with deep-learning-based color FPP. Through "learning" on extensive data sets, the properly trained neural network can "predict" the high-resolution, motion-artifact-free, crosstalk-free absolute phase directly from one single color fringe image. Compared with the traditional approach, our method allows for more accurate phase retrieval and more robust phase unwrapping. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide high-accuracy single-frame absolute 3D shape measurement for complicated objects. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America

AB Big data has become the ubiquitous watch word of medical innovation. The rapid development of machine-learning techniques and artificial intelligence in particular has promised to revolutionize medical practice from the allocation of resources to the diagnosis of complex diseases. But with big data comes big risks and challenges, among them significant questions about patient privacy. Here, we outline the legal and ethical challenges big data brings to patient privacy. We discuss, among other topics, how best to conceive of health privacy; the importance of equity, consent, and patient governance in data collection; discrimination in data uses; and how to handle data breaches. We close by sketching possible ways forward for the regulatory system.

AB Machine-learning potentials (MLPs) for atomistic simulations are a promising alternative to conventional classical potentials. Current approaches rely on descriptors of the local atomic environment with dimensions that increase quadratically with the number of chemical species. In this paper, we demonstrate that such a scaling can be avoided in practice. We show that a mathematically simple and computationally efficient descriptor with constant complexity is sufficient to represent transition-metal oxide compositions and biomolecules containing 11 chemical species with a precision of around 3 meV/atom. This insight removes a perceived bound on the utility of MLPs and paves the way to investigate the physics of previously inaccessible materials with more than ten chemical species.

ID DEBLOCKING
AB Recently, the advancements of Internet-of-Things (IoT) have expanded its application in underwater environment which leads to the development of a new field of Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). It offers a broader view of applications such as atmosphere observation, habitat monitoring of sea animals, defense and disaster prediction. Data transmission of images captured by the smart underwater objects is very challenging due to the nature of underwater environment and necessitates an efficient image transmission strategy for IoUT. In this paper, we model and implement a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based deep learning model for image compression in IoUT. For achieving effective compression with better reconstruction image quality, convolution neural network (CNN) is used at the encoding as well as decoding side. We validate DWT-CNN model using extensive set of experimentations and depict that the presented deep learning model is superior to existing methods such as super-resolution convolutional neural networks (SRCNN), JPEG and JPEG2000 in terms of compression performance as well as reconstructed image quality. The DWT-CNN model attains an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 53.961 with average space saving (SS) of 79.7038%.

TI Towards automatic pulmonary nodule management in lung cancer screening
   with deep learning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID CT IMAGES; CLASSIFICATION
AB The introduction of lung cancer screening programs will produce an unprecedented amount of chest CT scans in the near future, which radiologists will have to read in order to decide on a patient follow-up strategy. According to the current guidelines, the workup of screen-detected nodules strongly relies on nodule size and nodule type. In this paper, we present a deep learning system based on multi-stream multi-scale convolutional networks, which automatically classifies all nodule types relevant for nodule workup. The system processes raw CT data containing a nodule without the need for any additional information such as nodule segmentation or nodule size and learns a representation of 3D data by analyzing an arbitrary number of 2D views of a given nodule. The deep learning system was trained with data from the Italian MILD screening trial and validated on an independent set of data from the Danish DLCST screening trial. We analyze the advantage of processing nodules at multiple scales with a multi-stream convolutional network architecture, and we show that the proposed deep learning system achieves performance at classifying nodule type that surpasses the one of classical machine learning approaches and is within the inter-observer variability among four experienced human observers.

TI Deep-learning-assisted diagnosis for knee magnetic resonance imaging:
   Development and retrospective validation of MRNet

AB Background
   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is the preferred method for diagnosing knee injuries. However, interpretation of knee MRI is time-intensive and subject to diagnostic error and variability. An automated system for interpreting knee MRI could prioritize high-risk patients and assist clinicians in making diagnoses. Deep learning methods, in being able to automatically learn layers of features, are well suited for modeling the complex relationships between medical images and their interpretations. In this study we developed a deep learning model for detecting general abnormalities and specific diagnoses (anterior cruciate ligament [ACL] tears and meniscal tears) on knee MRI exams. We then measured the effect of providing the model's predictions to clinical experts during interpretation.
   Methods and findings
   Our dataset consisted of 1,370 knee MRI exams performed at Stanford University Medical Center between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2012 (mean age 38.0 years; 569 [41.5%] female patients). The majority vote of 3 musculoskeletal radiologists established reference standard labels on an internal validation set of 120 exams. We developed MRNet, a convolutional neural network for classifying MRI series and combined predictions from 3 series per exam using logistic regression. In detecting abnormalities, ACL tears, and meniscal tears, this model achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 0.937 (95% CI 0.895, 0.980), 0.965 (95% CI 0.938, 0.993), and 0.847 (95% CI 0.780, 0.914), respectively, on the internal validation set. We also obtained a public dataset of 917 exams with sagittal T1 -weighted series and labels for ACL injury from Clinical Hospital Centre Rijeka, Croatia. On the external validation set of 183 exams, the MRNet trained on Stanford sagittal T2-weighted series achieved an AUC of 0.824 (95% CI 0.757, 0.892) in the detection of ACL injuries with no additional training, while an MRNet trained on the rest of the external data achieved an AUC of 0.911 (95% CI 0.864, 0.958). We additionally measured the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of 9 clinical experts (7 board-certified general radiologists and 2 orthopedic surgeons) on the internal validation set both with and without model assistance. Using a 2-sided Pearson's chi-squared test with adjustment for multiple comparisons, we found no significant differences between the performance of the model and that of unassisted general radiologists in detecting abnormalities. General radiologists achieved significantly higher sensitivity in detecting ACL tears (p-value = 0.002; q-value = 0.019) and significantly higher specificity in detecting meniscal tears (p-value = 0.003; q-value = 0.019). Using a 1-tailed ttest on the change in performance metrics, we found that providing model predictions significantly increased clinical experts' specificity in identifying ACL tears (p-value < 0.001; q-value = 0.006). The primary limitations of our study include lack of surgical ground truth and the small size of the panel of clinical experts.
   Conclusions
   Our deep learning model can rapidly generate accurate clinical pathology classifications of knee MRI exams from both internal and external datasets. Moreover, our results support the assertion that deep learning models can improve the performance of clinical experts during medical imaging interpretation. Further research is needed to validate the model prospectively and to determine its utility in the clinical setting.

AB This technical note presents a second-order multi-agent network for distributed optimization with a sum of convex objective functions subject to bound constraints. In the multi-agent network, the agents connect each others locally as an undirected graph and know only their own objectives and constraints. The multi-agent network is proved to be able to reach consensus to the optimal solution under mild assumptions. Moreover, the consensus of the multi-agent network is converted to the convergence of a dynamical system, which is proved using the Lyapunov method. Compared with existing multi-agent networks for optimization, the second-order multi-agent network herein is capable of solving more general constrained distributed optimization problems. Simulation results on two numerical examples are presented to substantiate the performance and characteristics of the multi-agent network.

AB The ability to predict local structural features of a protein from the primary sequence is of paramount importance for unraveling its function in absence of experimental structural information. Two main factors affect the utility of potential prediction tools: their accuracy must enable extraction of reliable structural information on the proteins of interest, and their runtime must be low to keep pace with sequencing data being generated at a constantly increasing speed. Here, we present NetSurfP-2.0, a novel tool that can predict the most important local structural features with unprecedented accuracy and runtime. NetSurfP-2.0 is sequence-based and uses an architecture composed of convolutional and long short-term memory neural networks trained on solved protein structures. Using a single integrated model, NetSurfP-2.0 predicts solvent accessibility, secondary structure, structural disorder, and backbone dihedral angles for each residue of the input sequences. We assessed the accuracy of NetSurfP-2.0 on several independent test datasets and found it to consistently produce state-of-the-art predictions for each of its output features. We observe a correlation of 80% between predictions and experimental data for solvent accessibility, and a precision of 85% on secondary structure 3-class predictions. In addition to improved accuracy, the processing time has been optimized to allow predicting more than 1000 proteins in less than 2 hours, and complete proteomes in less than 1 day.
